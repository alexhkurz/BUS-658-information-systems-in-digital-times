---

## Goals for Class

- Topic: Think about the bigger picture and longer term impact of the digital tools you are learning: specifically *AI*, *Analytics*, and *Digital Networks*

- Tools: Practice reading, discussing, and using LLMs as a learning assistant for foundational and cutting edge tech and econ of tech research

- Deliverables: A chance to further develop portfolio project; a refined appreciation of plausible longer-term career trajectories

---

## Typical Weekly Format

- Do readings in the days leading up to class, assigned week before
- A small assignment due Wednesday: e.g. Developing one *good* question based on the readings for discussion
- An introductory lecture on the topics of the day
- A lab or breakout session
- A regrouping for a closing discussion


*Breaks in between*

---

## Logistics

- **Meeting**: Thursdays **7:00–9:50pm** (break included), **Beckman 104**
- **Materials**: no textbook; readings posted on the course site

---

## Course roadmap (tentative)

- **Unit 1 (Weeks 2–8)**: AI foundations; automation & the economy; alignment, regulation and the farther future
  - **Reflection 1 due**
- **Unit 2 (Weeks 9–12)**: Digital platforms + the digital ecosystem
  - platform tech (e.g. APIs, MCPs, crypto); decentralized + AI ecosystems; the *Power Law Economy*
  - **Reflection 2 due**
- **Weeks 13–14**: Project presentations

---

## Before Class

- Submit **one question** about the reading **the day before** class.
- Include a link that shows the conversation with the LLM.
- Include a link to an LLM answer to the question you believe is inadequate.

---

## Some Topics I Think are Interesting

## Lab: What makes a question *interesting*?

- Lab: Use **LLMs** + **Google Scholar** to elaborate an *interesting* question 
- Discussion: Summarize your conversation at [Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/ryT_nVMD-l)

---

## Method of finding an interesting question

Converse with AI until you don't get a good answer anymore. Ask the AI to link the most relevant scholarly resources on the topic. Read some of them. 

--- 

## Example: HI vs AI

I recently had a conversation about the future of humanity in times of AI. Here is a stepping stone I came up with after several iterations, worthy of further development

Brief history of Intelligent Machines:

- [McCulloch & Pitts (1943)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./epxing/Class/10715/reading/McCulloch.and.Pitts.pdf): Neural Networks
- [Von Neumann (1944)](https://archive.org/details/20200901-vN_First_Draft_Report_EDVAC_Moore_Sch_1945/page/n19/mode/2up): **AI-as-logical-deduction**
- Machines are better at I-as-logical-deduction than Hs
- [Rosenblatt (1958)](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs501/Rosenblatt1958.pdf): **AI-as-probabilistic-pattern-recognition**
- Machines are better at I-as-probabilistic-pattern-recognition than Hs
  
What is left for humans?

Hint: [210 reasons are no reason at all](https://courses.washington.edu/rome250/gallery/ROME%20250/210%20Reasons.htm)

## Instructions for the Lab

1. Go to [PantherAi](https://pantherai.chapman.edu/), choose a model
2. Ask a question ... Ask a follow up question ... etc
3. Make a mental model of the emerging landscape
4. Ask to inline links to google scholar queries, wikipedia, etc
5. Also read outside of the AI
6. Until (end) go back to 2
7. Make a one slide summary at [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/PVMx34caTxKPrE09uYV9tw?both#/)
8. Export the dialogue with the AI and share it via [Rentry.co](https://rentry.co/)
