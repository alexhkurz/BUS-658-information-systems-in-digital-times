---

## Goals for Class

- Topic: Think about the bigger picture and longer term impact of the digital tools you are learning: specifically *AI*, *Analytics*, and *Digital Networks*

- Tools: Practice reading, discussing, and using LLMs as a learning assistant for foundational and cutting edge tech and econ of tech research

- Deliverables: A chance to further develop portfolio project; a refined appreciation of plausible longer-term career trajectories

---

## Typical Weekly Format

- Do readings in the days leading up to class, assigned week before
- A small assignment due Wednesday: e.g. Developing one *good* question based on the readings for discussion
- An introudctory lecture on the topics of the day
- A lab or breakout session
- A regrouping for a closing discussion


*Breaks in between*

---

## Logistics

- **Meeting**: Thursdays **7:00–9:50pm** (break included), **Beckman 104**
- **Materials**: no textbook; readings posted on the course site


  I would also like to set up an *optional* schedule for:
-group reading
-maybe 2 movie nights?

Alex will set up a system for submitting the weekly small assignments

---

## Course roadmap (tentative)

- **Unit 1 (Weeks 2–8)**: AI foundations; automation & the economy; alignment, regulation and the farther future
  - **Reflection 1 due**
- **Unit 2 (Weeks 9–12)**: Digital platforms + the digital ecosystem
  - platform tech (e.g. APIs, MCPs, crypto); decentralized + AI ecosystems; the *Power Law Economy*
  - **Reflection 2 due**
- **Weeks 13–14**: Project presentations

---

## Before Class

- Submit **1–2 questions** about the reading **the day before**
- Also include an LLM answer to the question you believe is inadequate

Aim for questions that are:
- **specific** (not “is AI good/bad?”)
- **answerable, but currently unknown** 
- **consequential** 
Some weeks we may ask you to do something else for your small assignment instead (e.g. finalize project teams)


---
## Some Topics I Think are Interesting
A conversation with Bo Cowgill of Columbia University
- The destruction of meaning vs. the coasian singularity
- Algorithmic bias vs. AI omniscience
- The future of data analytics careers

---

## Seth’s research: the questions

- When does **automation** raise overall welfare vs. create hidden losses?
- How does AI change **investment**, **wages**, and the **distribution** of gains?
- Why do **APIs** change how firms are organized and how markets evolve?
- How should we measure benefits/costs of digital systems when the “outputs” are information, attention, or coordination?

---

## Seth’s research: automation & AI (macro lens)

Focus: how new technologies reshape the economy over time.

- Mechanisms: **directed technical change**, diffusion, substitution/complementarity
- Outcomes: productivity, wages, inequality, welfare
- The key difficulty: the future is uncertain—models must be disciplined by data

---

## Seth’s research: platforms, APIs, and “inverting the firm”

APIs can turn an organization “inside out”:
- capabilities become **modules** other firms can build on
- coordination shifts from internal hierarchy to **ecosystems**

Questions:
- When does openness create growth vs. create strategic risk?
- How do interfaces affect competition, innovation, and market power?

---

## Seth’s research: networks, institutions, and real-world measurement

- **Networks** aren’t just social graphs—they transmit incentives, information, and conflict
- Empirics can be messy: definitions, baselines, and identification matter

The habit: be explicit about
- what’s measured
- what’s assumed
- what would falsify the story

---

## Why this course exists

Digital technologies are reshaping:
- **Production** (automation, AI augmentation, new firms)
- **Coordination** (platforms, protocols, decentralized systems)
- **Information** (attention, persuasion, measurement, “evals”)

We’ll learn to **reason clearly** about these changes using math, evidence, and debate.

---

## What this class is

- **Interdisciplinary**: economics, data/CS, information systems, policy
- **Analytical**: we’ll go beyond hot takes
- **Research-oriented**: practice finding questions worth answering
- **Future-facing**: what should/shouldn’t exist, and why

---

## Learning objectives (by the end)

You should be able to:
- Understand foundations behind **AI + digital platforms** (e.g., neural nets, attention, online protocols, distributed consensus)
- Generate strong **research + discussion questions** using LLMs + scholarly search
- Analyze impacts of AI/platforms on **economy, business, society** using theory + evidence
- Work in teams to **analyze data** or propose solutions around AI/digital tech
- Evaluate future implications: **ethics, social effects, regulation**

---

## How we’ll use AI tools in this class

LLMs are encouraged for:
- brainstorming and refining **research questions**
- mapping a literature quickly (with **Google Scholar**)
- generating **testable predictions**, counterarguments, and “what would change my mind?”

LLMs are not a substitute for:
- **reading** (or checking methods, assumptions, and identification)
- **measurement** (data, definitions, baselines, confidence intervals)
- **owning your beliefs**

---

## “Justified Posteriors” (a class habit)

Borrowing from the *Justified Posteriors* idea:
- Start with a **prior** (what do you believe, and how strongly?)
- Engage the **evidence** (paper, data, model, assumptions)
- State your **posterior** (how did your belief change, and why?)
- Name what would change your mind **next**

---

## How discussions will work

- We’ll treat readings as **inputs**, not authorities
- We’ll separate:
  - **claims** (what the author says)
  - **evidence** (what supports it)
  - **assumptions** (what must be true)
  - **implications** (if true, what follows?)
- Updating your view is a **win**, not a loss

---

## Grading (high level)

- **20%** Participation (quality of contributions)
- **20%** Discussion questions (submitted day before class)
- **15%** Reflection 1 (Weeks 4–6 window)
- **15%** Reflection 2 (Weeks 10–12 window)
- **30%** Final project

---

## Reflections (what “good” looks like)

- 500–1,000 words
- A clear claim + **reasoning**
- Evidence or a concrete example
- Acknowledges uncertainty and alternatives

---

## Final project (choose a format)

Examples (not exhaustive):
- **Empirical analysis** with public/collected data
- **Software/demo** of a digital platform feature
- **Film/prototype experience** + consequences
- **Business plan + pitch** for a socially beneficial product

Teams are encouraged (interdisciplinary is a feature).



<!-- _class: lead -->
## Week 1: what I want from you

- Show up ready to **ask** and **improve** questions

## Lab: What makes a question *interesting*?

- Lab: Use **LLMs** + **Google Scholar** to elaborate an *interesting* question 
- Discussion: Summarize your conversation at [Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/ryT_nVMD-l)

---

## Method of finding an interesting question

Converse with AI until you don't get a good answer anymore. Ask the AI to link the most relevant scholarly resources on the topic. Read some of them. 

--- 

## Example: HI vs AI

I recently had a conversation about the future of humanity in times of AI. Here is a stepping stone I came up after several iterations, worth of further development

---

> Brief history of Intelligent Machines:
> 
> - [McCulloch & Pitts (1943)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./epxing/Class/10715/reading/McCulloch.and.Pitts.pdf): Neural Networks
> - [Von Neumann (1944)](https://archive.org/details/20200901-vN_First_Draft_Report_EDVAC_Moore_Sch_1945/page/n19/mode/2up): **AI-as-logical-deduction**
> - Machines are better at I-as-logical-deduction than Hs
> - [Rosenblatt (1958)](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs501/Rosenblatt1958.pdf): **AI-as-probablistic-pattern-recognition**
> - Machines are better at I-as-probabilistic-pattern-recognition than Hs
>   
> What is left for humans?
