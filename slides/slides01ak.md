## Lab: What makes a question *interesting*?

- Lab: Use **LLMs** + **Google Scholar** to elaborate an *interesting* question 
- Discussion: Summarize your conversation at [Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/ryT_nVMD-l)

## Instructions for the Lab

1. Go to [PantherAi](https://pantherai.chapman.edu/), choose a model
2. Ask a question ... Ask a follow up question ... etc
3. Make a mental model of  the emergin landscape
4. Ask to inline links to google scholar queries, wikipedia, etc
5. Also read outside of the AI
6. Until (end) go back to 2
7. Make a one slide summary at [HackMd](https://hackmd.io/PVMx34caTxKPrE09uYV9tw?both#/
)
8. Export the dialogue with the AI and share it via [Rentry.co](https://rentry.co/)
