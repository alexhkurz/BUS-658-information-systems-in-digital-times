## Lab: What makes a question *interesting*?

- Lab: Use **LLMs** + **Google Scholar** to elaborate an *interesting* question 
- Discussion: Summarize your conversation at [Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/ryT_nVMD-l)

---

## Method of finding an interesting question

Converse with AI until you don't get a good answer anymore. Ask the AI to link the most relevant scholarly resources on the topic. Read some of them. 

--- 

## Example: HI vs AI

I recently had a conversation about the future of humanity in times of AI. Here is a stepping stone I came up after several iterations, worth of further development

> Brief history of Intelligent Machines:
> 
> - [McCulloch & Pitts (1943)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./epxing/Class/> 10715/reading/McCulloch.and.Pitts.pdf): Neural Networks
> - [Von Neumann (1944)](https://archive.org/details/> 20200901-vN_First_Draft_Report_EDVAC_Moore_Sch_1945/page/n19/mode/2up): > **AI-as-logical-deduction**
> - Machines are better at I-as-logical-deduction than Hs
> - [Rosenblatt (1958)](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs501/> Rosenblatt1958.pdf): **AI-as-probablistic-pattern-recognition**
> - Machines are better at I-as-probabilistic-pattern-recognition than Hs
>   
> What is left for humans?

## Instructions for the Lab

1. Go to [PantherAi](https://pantherai.chapman.edu/), choose a model
2. Ask a question ... Ask a follow up question ... etc
3. Make a mental model of  the emergin landscape
4. Ask to inline links to google scholar queries, wikipedia, etc
5. Also read outside of the AI
6. Until (end) go back to 2
7. Make a one slide summary at [HackMd](https://hackmd.io/PVMx34caTxKPrE09uYV9tw?both#/
)
8. Export the dialogue with the AI and share it via [Rentry.co](https://rentry.co/)
