# Information Systems in Digital Times, BUS 658

## Introduction

**Course Meetings**:  One weekly three hour class with break (7:00 - 9:50pm Thursdays in Beckman 104)

**Course Materials**: No textbook; required readings will be posted on course website

**Learning Objectives**: By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand the mathematical foundations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital platforms, including neural networks, attention, online communication protocols and distributed consensus 
- Generate insightful research and discussion questions using Large Language Models (LLMs) and other research tools.
- Analyze the impact of AI and digital platforms on the economy, business, and society, using macroeconomic theory and empirical evidence
- Critically evaluate the future implications of AI and digital platforms, including ethical, social, and regulatory aspects.
- Work collaboratively to statistically analyze empirical questions about or propose innovative solutions to challenges around AI and digital technologies, and build a project portfolio


## Grading and Assignments

- 20% Participation in class participation
    - One of the co-teachers will monitor class discussion participation quality
        - Put in a grade every day on each of these (good, mediocre, zero); 0, 1, 2
- 20% Student discussion questions or other weekly assignment
    - The day before class, students will be required to submit 1 question based on the scheduled reading. These will be graded rigorously based on the knowledge students will have access to LLMs and the internet (and encouraged to use them!) when generating them. 
    - An explanation of why this is an interesting question, for example in form of a link to unsatisfactory answer by an LLM, together with a sentence of why this is a not a good answer.
    - Or alternate, closely related, weekly assignment
- 15% Reflection 1:
    - At the end of week 5, we will suggest to each student a topic for reflection based on one of their proposed questions. 
    - Students will have two weeks to complete a 500-1,000 word reflection on this topic; encourage or require an analytical element?
- 15% Reflection 2:
    - At the end of week 10, we will suggest to each student a second reflection topic based on their proposed questions
    - Students will have two weeks to complete a 500-1,000 word reflection on this topic.
- 30% Final Project
    - The final project will ask students to imagine how AI and digital technologies could or should be used in the future.  Possible forms include, but are not limited to:
        - A novel statistical analysis, based on public or collected data, meant to answer an empirical question about the effect of technology on some outcome
        - A computer program demo-ing some digital platform feature they hope to emerge
        - A film visualizing the user experience for a proposed or speculative AI or digital technology, and investigating it’s consequences
        - A business plan and investment pitch for a profitable and socially beneficial enterprise using these technologies
    - We will encourage students to form teams of two to work on these projects, although they will be allowed to work individually. Grading will take into account the size of the team, but grading rigor will scale sub-linearly in group size to encourage groups. 
    - We encourage you to continue developing a portfolio project as your final project.

## Preliminary Course Schedule

- Unit 0 - Course Introduction: 
<!--    - Week 1: Teach students how to use LLMs in combination with Google Scholar to generate good research and discussion questions about readings, and to do follow up research on these questions. We see teaching students what counts as an interesting question to be a lesson of true value. --> 


- Unit 1 - Artificial Intelligence: 
    - Week 2 + 3: What is AI? Readings about the foundations of AI. 
    - Week 3, 4, 5: Will Automation Save or Doom the Economy? Readings on AI, alignment, and economic issues.
    - Week 6 + 7, The Near and Far Future. Readings on Culture and AI. 
    - Unit 1 Reflection Due

- Unit 2 - Digital Platforms
    - Week 8 + 9: What are Digital Platforms and their Technologies? Readings on social and economics networs and the mathematics of crypto.
    - Week 10 +  11: Digital Platforms Today. Reading about the golden age of digital content and the enshittification of platforms.
    - Week 12: Digital Platforms in the Future. Readings about the emerging decentralized +AI ecosystems
    - Unit 2 Reflection Due

- Wrap-up/Project Presentations: Week 13 + 14
  - Presentation Week 1
  - Presentation Week 2

## Late Policy

If you need more time for an assignment 
- convince the instructor that you already have done substantial work (for example by showing me the code in your GitHub repository);
- explain the special circumstances that would allow the instructor to justify giving you more time.

This needs to be done before the deadline. No extension for the final project presentations.


## Participation

It is expected that students attend every lecture. Let us now if you have a religious or medical issue.

## Course Assessment 
At some point during the semester, you will be asked to complete a course assessment. This assessment is very important in evaluating how effective the course is meeting its learning outcomes. The assessment will not harm your grade and may be included as a small portion of your participation grade.
