# Information Systems in Digital Times, BUS 658

(draft)

## Introduction

**Course Meetings**:  One weekly three hour class with break (7:00 - 9:50pm Thursdays in Beckman 104)

**Course Materials**: No textbook; required readings will be posted on course website

<!--
**Course Listing and Required Background**: 
- We’re targeting advanced undergraduates or masters students focused on data analytics, economics, humanomics (ACBE) computer science, data science, software engineering, or computer engineering (FSOE). 
- The course should be cross-listed as an elective course in the MBA and the masters program at the engineering school
- Required coursework: MGSC 209 OR MATH 203 OR Instructor’s approval
-->

**Learning Objectives**: By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand the mathematical foundations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital platforms, including neural networks, attention, online communication protocols and distributed consensus 
- Generate insightful research and discussion questions using Large Language Models (LLMs) and other research tools.
- Analyze the impact of AI and digital platforms on the economy, business, and society, using macroeconomic theory and empirical evidence
- Critically evaluate the future implications of AI and digital platforms, including ethical, social, and regulatory aspects.
- Work collaboratively to statistically analyze empirical questions about or propose innovative solutions to challenges around AI and digital technologies, and build a project portfolio


## Grading and Assignments

- 20% Participation in class participation
    - One of the co-teachers will monitor class discussion participation quality
        - Put in a grade every day on each of these (good, mediocre, zero); 0, 1, 2
- 20% Student discussion questions
    - The day before class, students will be required to submit a questions based on the scheduled reading. These will be graded rigorously based on the knowledge students will have access to LLMs and the internet (and encouraged to use them!) when generating them. 
    - Students should also include evidence that easily available e.g. LLM answers are inadequate
- 15% Reflection 1:
    - At the end of week 5, we will suggest to each student a topic for reflection based on one of their proposed questions. 
    - Students will have two weeks to complete a 500-1,000 word reflection on this topic
- 15% Reflection 2:
    - At the end of week 10, we will suggest to each student a second reflection topic based on their proposed questions
    - Students will have two weeks to complete a 500-1,000 word reflection on this topic.
- 30% Final Project
    - The final project will ask students to imagine how AI and digital technologies could or should be used in the future.  Possible forms include, but are not limited to:
        - A novel statistical analysis, based on public or collected data, meant to answer an empirical question about the effect of technology on some outcome
        - A computer program demo-ing some digital platform feature they hope to emerge
        - A film visualizing the user experience for a proposed or speculative AI or digital technology, and investigating it’s consequences
        - A business plan and investment pitch for a profitable and socially beneficial enterprise using these technologies
    - We will encourage students to form interdisciplinary teams to work on these projects, although they will be allowed to work individually. Grading will take into account the size of the team, but grading rigor will scale sub-linearly in group size to encourage groups. 
    - Students are encouraged to continue developing and polishing existing related projects as their final project for this course

## Preliminary Course Schedule

- Unit 0 - Course Introduction: 
<!--    - Week 1: Teach students how to use LLMs in combination with Google Scholar to generate good research and discussion questions about readings, and to do follow up research on these questions. We see teaching students what counts as an interesting question to be a lesson of true value. -->

    - Week 2 + 3: What is AI? Readings about the foundations of AI. 
    - Week 3, 4, 5: Will Automation Save or Doom the Economy? Readings on AI, alignment, and economic issues.
    - Week 6 + 7, The Near and Far Future. Readings on Culture and AI. 
    - Unit 1 Reflection Due

- Unit 2 - Digital Platforms
    - Week 8 + 9: What are Digital Platforms and their Technologies? Readings on social and economics networs and the mathematics of crypto.
