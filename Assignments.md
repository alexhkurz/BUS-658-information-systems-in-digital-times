# Information Systems in Digital Times, BUS 658

In this course there are four types of assignments:

- A weekly set of readings (see the folder "readings")
- A small weekly assignment, typically writing an interesting discussion question based on the readings (see slides01 for details)
- Two 'reflection' assignments of 500-1000 words where you further develop one of these questions. 
- A final project.

Details on the final project and the reflections to come. 


## Weekly Assignments

- Assignment Due 2-11-26 (Week 1)
  - After completing assigned readings, develop an interesting question for class
  - The question should connect to the readings
  - Your submission should take the form of a question, as well as a discussion of why it is an interesting question, which can take the form of a chat log with LLMs as you iterated refining the question
  - This assignment is due midnight before the day of class, submitted to Discord


## Advice on developing interesting questions

The following is reproduced from the first week's slides

- Submit **1 question** about the reading **the day before**
- The question should connect to the weekly readings
- Also include a discussion of why the question is interesting. This can take the form of
  - an LLM answer to the question you believe is inadequate (with explanation)
  - your iterations with an LLM as you refine the question
  - your own discussion of why you find the question interesting

Aim for questions that are:
- **specific** (not “is AI good/bad?”)
- **answerable, but currently unknown** 
- **consequential** 
Some weeks we may ask you to do something else for your small assignment instead
