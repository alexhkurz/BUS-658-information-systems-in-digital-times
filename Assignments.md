# Information Systems in Digital Times, BUS 658

In this course there are four types of assignments:

- A weekly set of readings (see the folder "readings")
- A small weekly assignment, typically writing an interesting discussion question based on the readings (see slides01 for details)
- Two 'reflection' assignments of 500-1000 words where you further develop one of these questions. 
- A final project.

Details on the final project and the reflections to come. 

## Week 2

This week's assignment builds on the "finding an interesting question with LLMs" assignment from last week and the lab of Lecture 2.

The task is to find an interesting question that can be answered with data analysis. You can continue with the question from Assignment Week 1, or develop a new question based on this week's readings. You are welcome to choose a question that you think could be relevant for your project. In fact, in Lecture 3, we will discuss your project ideas.

In terms of developing the question, together with a plan of how to answer it, use a method similar to what we discussed in Lecture 1 and practiced in Assignment Week 1. 

Submit both the full conversation with the LLM as a markdown file and a one page summary of the methodology you want to use for your data analysis.

(And don't forget the readings.)

## Week 1

- Assignment Due 2-11-26 (Week 1)
  - After completing assigned readings, develop an interesting question for class
  - The question should connect to the readings
  - Your submission should take the form of a question, as well as a discussion of why it is an interesting question, which can take the form of a chat log with LLMs as you iterated refining the question
  - This assignment is due midnight before the day of class, submitted to Discord


## Advice on developing interesting questions

The following is reproduced from the first week's slides

- Submit **1 question** about the reading **the day before**
- The question should connect to the weekly readings
- Also include a discussion of why the question is interesting. This can take the form of
  - an LLM answer to the question you believe is inadequate (with explanation)
  - your iterations with an LLM as you refine the question
  - your own discussion of why you find the question interesting

- Show up ready to **ask** and **improve** questions
- Bring a point of view, but be willing to **update**
- Be precise: definitions, baselines, mechanisms

Welcome to BUS 658.

Aim for questions that are:
- **specific** (not “is AI good/bad?”)
- **answerable, but currently unknown** 
- **consequential** 
Some weeks we may ask you to do something else for your small assignment instead
