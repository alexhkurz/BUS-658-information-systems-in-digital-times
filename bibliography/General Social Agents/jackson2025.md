## Summary

This paper outlines the emerging field of "AI Behavioral Science" at the intersection of artificial intelligence and behavioural science. The discussion centres on three reinforcing themes: (1) assessing and guiding AI behaviour—developing tools to evaluate what objectives AI agents implicitly pursue and how they act in different scenarios, drawing on behavioural science methods for measurement and normative design; (2) using AI to advance behavioural science—leveraging AI for simulation, prediction, and new research techniques at scale; (3) understanding AI–human interactions—how AI changes human knowledge and behaviour, and how humans and AI influence each other in layered ecosystems. The paper grew out of a workshop at CASBS in spring 2025 and addresses questions such as how to understand AI's biases and heuristics, how to design AI for human interaction, and how society can prepare for economic and behavioural shifts as AI augments and displaces humans.

## Relevance to our project

### Conceptual Framework
- Defines AI Behavioral Science as a field with three pillars
- Provides structure for thinking about AI–human interaction
- Relevant to course themes on information systems and digital times

### Assessing AI Behaviour
- Emphasises evaluating AI based on behaviour when code is proprietary
- Connects to alignment and interpretability
- Relevant to understanding when AI can serve as human proxy

### Using AI for Research
- Discusses AI for simulation and prediction in social science
- Complements papers on LLM social simulations
- Relevant to methodology of using AI in research

### AI–Human Interaction
- Addresses how AI influences human behaviour and beliefs
- Discusses externalities and information ecosystems
- Relevant to policy and design discussions

## Key concepts

- **AI Behavioral Science**: Field at intersection of AI and behavioural science
- **Assessing AI behaviour**: Evaluating objectives and actions of AI agents
- **Design for welfare**: Using behavioural science to optimise AI for individual and social welfare
- **AI–human ecosystems**: Layered interactions (person–AI–platform–other AIs)

## Notes

The paper takes a broad definition of AI (from clocks to LLMs) and focuses on behaviour rather than implementation. The three-pillar framework is useful for organising research and teaching. The emphasis on normative design—what kinds of behaviour improve or harm human welfare—connects to alignment and policy. The workshop origin (CASBS 2025) reflects growing institutional interest in this intersection.
