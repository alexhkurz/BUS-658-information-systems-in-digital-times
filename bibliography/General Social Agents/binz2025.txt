Abstract
Establishing a unified theory of cognition has been a major goal of psychology
[1, 2]. While there have been previous attempts to instantiate such theories by
building computational models [1, 2], we currently do not have one model that
captures the human mind in its entirety. A first step in this direction is to create
a model that can predict human behavior in a wide range of settings. Here we
introduce Centaur, a computational model that can predict and simulate human
behavior in any experiment expressible in natural language. We derived Centaur
by finetuning a state-of-the-art language model on a novel, large-scale data set
called Psych-101. Psych-101 reaches an unprecedented scale, covering trial-bytrial data from over 60,000 participants performing over 10,000,000 choices in
160 experiments. Centaur not only captures the behavior of held-out participants
better than existing cognitive models, but also generalizes to new cover stories,
structural task modifications, and entirely new domains. Furthermore, we find
that the model’s internal representations become more aligned with human neural activity after finetuning. Taken together, our results demonstrate that it is
possible to discover computational models that capture human behavior across a
wide range of domains. We believe that such models provide tremendous potential for guiding the development of cognitive theories and present a case study to
demonstrate this.

Introduction
The human mind is remarkably general [3–5]. Not only do we routinely make mundane
decisions, like choosing a breakfast cereal or selecting an outfit, but we also tackle
complex challenges, such as figuring out how to cure cancer or explore outer space.
We learn new skills from only a few demonstrations [6], reason causally [7], and fuel
our actions through curiosity [8]. Whether we are climbing mountains, playing video
games, or creating captivating art, our versatility defines what it means to be human.
In contrast to this, most contemporary computational models – whether in machine
learning or the cognitive sciences – are domain-specific. They are designed to excel
at one particular problem and that problem alone. Take, for instance, AlphaGo – a
computer system created by Google DeepMind to master the game of Go [9]. Even
though the system can play this particular game at an impressive level, it can do
not much beyond that. A similar pattern can be observed in the cognitive sciences.
Prospect theory, one of the most influential accounts of human cognition, for instance,
offers valuable insights into how people make choices [10], but it tells us nothing about
how we learn, plan, or explore.
If we want to understand the human mind in its entirety, we must move from
domain-specific theories to an integrated one. The importance of such a unified
approach has already been recognized by the pioneers of our field. For example, in
1990, Newell stated that “unified theories of cognition are the only way to bring [our]

Centaur: a foundation model of human cognition

Fig. 1 Psych-101 and Centaur overview. a, Psych-101 comprises of trial-by-trial data from 160
psychological experiments and 60,092 participants, making 10,681,650 choices in total. It contains
domains such as multi-armed bandits, decision-making, memory, supervised learning, Markov decision
processes, and others (shown examples are stylized and abbreviated for readability). b, Centaur is a
foundation of model human cognition that is obtained by adding low-rank adapters to a state-of-theart language model and finetuning it on Psych-101.

wonderful, increasing fund of knowledge under intellectual control” [2]. How can we
make meaningful progress toward such theories?
An important step towards a unified theory of cognition is to build a computational model that can predict and simulate human behavior in any domain [2, 11].
The present paper takes up this challenge and introduces Centaur – the first foundation model of human cognition [12]. Centaur was designed in a data-driven manner
by finetuning a state-of-the-art large language model [13] on a large corpus of human
behavior. For this purpose, we curated a novel, large-scale data set called Psych-101,
covering trial-by-trial data from 160 psychological experiments. We transcribed each of
these experiments into natural language, which provides a common format for expressing vastly different experimental paradigms [14, 15]. The resulting data set reaches an
unprecedented scale, containing over 10,000,000 human choices and including many
canonical studies from domains such as multi-armed bandits, decision-making, memory, supervised learning, Markov decision processes, and others (see Figure 1a for an
overview and examples).
We subject Centaur to a series of rigorous tests and demonstrate that it captures
human behavior at several levels of generalization. First, we show that Centaur predicts
behavior of held-out participants (i.e., participants that are not part of the training
data) better than existing cognitive models in almost every single experiment. We then
3

demonstrate that its ability to capture human behavior also generalizes to held-out
experiments. In this context, we find that Centaur accurately predicts human behavior
under modified cover stories, problem structures, and even in entirely novel domains.
Finally, we show that Centaur’s internal representations become more human-aligned,
even though it was never explicitly trained to capture human neural activity.
Taken together, our results demonstrate that it is possible to discover computational models that capture human behavior across a wide range of domains. We believe
that such a predictive model offers many direct opportunities to obtain a better understanding of the human mind [16, 17] and present a case study that demonstrates this
potential.

Results
Model overview
We built Centaur on top of the open-source language model Llama 3.1 70B – a stateof-the-art model pre-trained by Meta AI [13] (hereafter, we refer to this model simply
as Llama). Having a large language model as the backbone allowed us to rely on the
vast amounts of knowledge that is present in these models [18]. The training process involved finetuning on Psych-101 using a parameter-efficient finetuning technique
known as quantized low-rank adaptation (QLoRA) [19]. QLoRA relies on a frozen fourbit quantized language model as a base model. While the parameters of the base model
are left unchanged, it adds so-called low-rank adapters, which contain only a few additional, trainable parameters (typically represented in a half-precision floating-point
format). In our case, we added low-rank adapters of rank r = 8 to all non-embedding
layers (i.e., all linear layers of the self-attention mechanisms and the feedforward networks) as illustrated in Figure 1b. With these settings, the newly added parameters
amount to 0.15% of the base model’s parameters. We then trained the model for one
epoch on the entire data set using a standard cross-entropy loss. We masked out the
loss for all tokens that do not correspond to human responses, thereby ensuring that
the model focuses on capturing human behavior and not on completing experimental instructions. The entire training process took approximately five days on an A100
80GB GPU. Further details on the finetuning procedure are provided in the Methods
section.

Centaur predicts human behavior better than domain-specific
cognitive models
We evaluated Centaur on different types of held-out data to demonstrate that it
robustly captures human behavior. In our first analysis, we tested whether it can predict behavior of participants that were not part of the training data. For this, we
split each transcribed experiment into two parts, and used 90% of participants for
training and retained 10% for testing. We measured goodness-of-fit to human choices
using negative log-likelihoods averaged across responses. Figure 2a presents the result
of this analysis, comparing Centaur against the base model without finetuning and

Centaur outperforms both Llama and a collection of domain-specific cognitive models in almost every
experiment. Note that we only included experiments for which we have implemented a domain-specific
cognitive model in this graphic and merged different studies using the same paradigm. A full table for

collection of domain-specific models that represent the state-of-the-art in the cognitive science literature. While there was substantial variance in predictability between
the experiments, finetuning always improved goodness-of-fit. The average difference
in log-likelihoods across experiments after finetuning was 0.14 (Centaur negative
log-likelihood: 0.44; Llama negative log-likelihood: 0.58; t = −144.22, p ≤ 0.0001).
Furthermore, we compared Centaur against the previously mentioned collection
of domain-specific cognitive models. These models include, amongst others, the generalized context model [20], a prospect theory model [21], and various reinforcement
learning models [22, 23]. Further technical details can be found in the Supplementary
Information. We observed that Centaur outperforms domain-specific cognitive models

5

in all but one experiment. The average difference in predicting human behavior to the
domain-specific cognitive models was 0.13 (cognitive models negative log-likelihood:
0.56; t = −178.7, p ≤ 0.0001).
The previous analyses have focused on predicting human responses conditioned
on previously executed behavior. We may ask whether Centaur can also generate
human-like behavior when simulated in an open-loop fashion (i.e., when feeding its
own responses back into the model). This setting arguably provides a much stronger
test for the model’s capabilities and is sometimes also referred to as model falsification [24]. To check whether Centaur survives this test, we ran open-loop simulations
in three different experimental paradigms and inspected the distributions of statistics that resulted from these simulations. First, we simulated Centaur on the horizon
task paradigm, a two-armed bandit task used to detect different types of exploration
strategies [23]. We found that Centaur achieved a performance comparable to human
participants, as well that it engaged in a similar level of uncertainty-guided, directed
exploration (see Figure 2b), a pattern that is absent in many contemporary language
models [14]. We also observed that Centaur’s behavior is well-aligned with the human
population, demonstrating that it does not merely model the behavior of the average
participant but rather the distribution over trajectories produced by the entire population. For example, in the two-step task – a well-known paradigm to tease apart
model-free and model-based reinforcement learning [22] – Centaur, like human subjects, produced trajectories in which learning is purely model-free, purely model-based,
and mixtures thereof (see Figure 2c). Lastly, we verified that Centaur fails at predicting non-human behavior. For this, we considered a study that required participants to
predict either human responses or responses of an artificial agent with matched statistics in four canonical economic games [25]. Mirroring the results of the original human
study, Centaur accurately predicted human responses (64% accuracy) but struggled
to predict artificial responses (35% accuracy; see Figure 2d). Taken together, these
results demonstrate that Centaur exhibits human-like characteristics across various
settings, confirming that it can generate meaningful open-loop behavior.

Probing increasingly complex generalization abilities
Thus far, we have shown that Centaur generalizes to previously unseen participants
performing experiments that were part of the training data. A true foundation model
of human cognition, however, must also capture behavior in any arbitrary experiment,
even if that experiment was not part of the training data. To probe whether Centaur
has this ability, we exposed it to a series of increasingly complex out-of-distribution
evaluations.
First, we investigated whether Centaur is robust in the face of changes to the cover
story. For this analysis, we relied on data collected by Feher da Silva and Hare [26],
who conducted a study using the aforementioned two-step task. In addition to the
canonical cover story (spaceships traveling to foreign planets in search of treasures),
their study introduced a novel cover story involving magical carpets. Importantly,
Psych-101 includes experiments using the canonical spaceship cover story [29, 30] but
no experiments with the magical carpet cover story. Yet, we still found that Centaur
captures human behavior in the magical carpet experiment of Feher da Silva and

Hare (see Figure 3a). Like in our previous analysis, we observed an improvement after
finetuning, as well as a favorable goodness-of-fit when compared to a domain-specific
cognitive model (Centaur negative log-likelihood: 0.51; Llama negative log-likelihood:
0.63; cognitive model negative log-likelihood: 0.61; all pairwise comparisons significant
with p ≤ 0.0001).
In a second out-of-distribution evaluation, we probed whether Centaur is robust
to modifications in task structure. To test this, we exposed it to a paradigm known
as Maggie’s farm [27]. Maggie’s farm extends the horizon task paradigm by adding
a third choice option. Psych-101 encompasses several two-armed bandit experiments
(including the horizon task) but not Maggie’s farm or any other three-armed bandit
experiments.1 Thus, this analysis provides a test of Centaur’s robustness to structural
task modifications. We found that Centaur captures human behavior on Maggie’s
farm as shown in Figure 3b. We again observed a benefit of finetuning, as well as a
favorable goodness-of-fit compared to a domain-specific cognitive model, which did
not generalize well to this setting (Centaur negative log-likelihood: 0.42; Llama negative log-likelihood: 0.62; cognitive model negative log-likelihood: 0.98; all pairwise
comparisons significant with p ≤ 0.0001).
Finally, we investigated whether Centaur can capture human behavior even in
entirely novel domains. In this context, we considered a study investigating logical reasoning [28]. While Psych-101 includes probabilistic and causal reasoning problems, we
purposefully excluded any studies involving logical reasoning. Like in the previous analyses, there was again a positive effect of finetuning (Centaur negative log-likelihood:

It does, however, contain multi-armed bandit experiments with more than three choice options.

7

1.65; Llama negative log-likelihood: 1.92; t = −50.39, p ≤ 0.0001; see Figure 3c). Note
that we did not compare to any domain-specific cognitive model in this setting, as it
is unclear how to construct a model that would make any meaningful transfer from
training data that does not include any related problems.
We consolidated these results by analyzing Centaur on six additional out-ofdistribution experimental paradigms that were not part of the training data in any
shape or form (including moral decision-making [31], economic games [32], naturalistic
category and reward learning [33], behavioral propensities [34], and a deep sequential
decision task [35]). Centaur robustly captured human behavior in all of these settings,
while smaller and non-finetuned models did not do so consistently. We present the
corresponding results in the Supplementary Information.
In addition to analyzing human choice data, we also examined whether Centaur
can predict human response times. Hick’s law [36] suggests that individual response
times are a linear function of the response entropy. Therefore, we extracted nearly
4,000,000 response times for a subset of experiments in Psych-101 and fitted three linear mixed effects models each predicting response time based on the response entropy
derived from a different model. We found that the response entropy derived from Centaur captured a larger proportion of the variance in response times (conditional R2 :
0.58) than those derived from Llama (conditional R2 : 0.4) and the cognitive models (conditional R2 : 0.38), thereby highlighting Centaur’s ability to predict measures
beyond pure choice data.
To demonstrate that the model does not degrade on problems it was pretrained
for, we furthermore verified it on a collection of benchmarks from the machine learning literature [37, 38]. We found that Centaur remains stable in performance-based
benchmarks, even improving over the base model in some of them [38]. Finally, in
benchmarks that measure human alignment, we observed a shift towards humanlike characteristics. Figure 4a depicts this improved alignment on a low-dimensional
embedding derived from ten behavioral metrics in CogBench, a benchmark to test the
cognitive abilities of large language models [37]. A more detailed description of these
additional benchmarking results can be found in the Supplementary Information.

Internal representations become more aligned to human neural
activity
Despite only being trained to match human behavior, we also wondered whether Centaur’s internal representations become more aligned with human neural activity. To
check whether this is the case, we conducted two analyses in which we predicted human
neural activity using the model’s internal representations [39, 40]. We first conducted
a whole-brain analysis, in which we predicted fMRI measurements of people performing the two-step task [41]. For this, we relied on data collected in a previous study [41],
involving 94 participants each making 300 choices. Participants were tested on either
the magical carpet cover story (that we already used in one of our earlier generalization analyses) or an abstract cover story. Neither of these two cover stories were part of
Centaur’s training data. We extracted recordings from models’ residual stream before
each choice and after feedback. We then aggregated human neural activity in each
region and regressed the aggregated activity on Centaur’s internal representations.

extracted from different layers. Control refers to a model that uses representations extracted from a
randomly-initialized transformer model with matched architecture.

This procedure was then repeated separately for each participant and region. Further
details can be found in the Methods section. Figure 4b shows the resulting Pearson
correlation coefficients across layers for both Centaur and Llama. We found that Centaur’s representations consistently outperform Llama’s representations in predicting
human neural activity (all p ≤ 0.001), suggesting that finetuning a model on largescale behavioral data aligned its internal representations to human neural activity. It
is worth noting that this type of analysis was only possible due to the expressivity
of Centaur’s representations, and that using representations of a traditional cognitive
model led to a substantially drop in performance (dashed line in Figure 4b).
We expanded these results in a second analysis, for which we relied on a previously
collected data set involving fMRI measurements of people reading simple, six-word
sentences, such as “That is such a beautiful picture!”[42]. We focused our analysis on
a subset of five participants who each passively read 1,000 sentences, spread across 20
experimental runs and two scanning sessions. The presented sentences were extracted
from nine corpora and selected to maximize semantic diversity. We closely followed
the protocol of the original study and predicted aggregated neural activity across
participants in the language network. We repeated this procedure for representations
extracted from different layers in both Centaur and Llama. Predictability peaked at
around layer 20 as shown in Figure 4c. This peak is consistent with the hypothesis that
the intermediate layers of such models contain the most amount of information [43].
We performed an inverse-weighted meta-analysis [44] on the difference in correlations
between Centaur and Llama which indicated that there was a significant benefit of
finetuning when pooling across layers (β = 0.007, 95% CI [0.0002, 0.013], p = 0.045).
While this effect was consistent across layers, it was not statistically significant for any
individual layer. Yet, this analysis demonstrates that Centaur’s alignment to human
neural activity increases (although only marginally) even for stimuli far away from its
training data, thereby highlighting the generalization abilities of the model.

Fig. 5 Model-guided scientific discovery. We used Psych-101 and Centaur to guide the development
of a cognitive model for a multi-attribute decision-making study. Each panel shows the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for the set of models considered at the given stage, starting with the models
considered in the original study. We first asked DeepSeek-R1 to generate an explanation for human
responses and formalized the resulting verbal strategy into a formal computational model. We then
further refined this model through scientific regret minimization using Centaur as a reference model.
Eight data points are visualized for which Centaur makes accurate predictions but the DeepSeekR1-discovered model does not. We then used this information to design a domain-specific cognitive
model that is as predictive as Centaur yet still interpretable.

Model-guided scientific discovery using Psych-101 and Centaur
Psych-101 and Centaur both constitute valuable tools for scientific discovery. In the
following section, we present an example for how each of them can be used to improve
our understanding of human decision-making. The individual steps of this process are
illustrated in Figure 5.
Psych-101 contains human behavioral data in a natural language format, which
means that it can be readily processed and analyzed by language-based reasoning
model, such as DeepSeek-R1 [45]. To demonstrate this use case, we asked DeepSeek-R1
to generate an explanation of participants’ behavior in a multi-attribute decisionmaking experiment [46]. The model produced several explanations, one of which caught
our attention: “The participant employed a two-step decision-making strategy. First,
they determined which product had the majority of positive ratings (1s) across all
experts. If the products were tied in the number of positive ratings, the participant
then considered the rating from the highest validity expert to break the tie.” This strategy combines two well-known heuristic decision-making strategies that – best to our
knowledge – have not been considered in this particular combination before. We then
took this verbal strategy, implemented it as a formal computational model, and found
that it indeed explained human response behavior more accurately than the three
strategies considered in the original study (a weighted-additive strategy, equal weighting, and the take-the-best heuristic). However, the DeepSeek-R1-discovered model

10

(AIC: 181.7) still fell short of the goodness-of-fit of Centaur (AIC: 72.5), indicating that
there is still room for improvement. We, therefore, turned towards a method known as
scientific regret minimization, which uses a black-box predictive model as a reference
to identify responses that are in principle predictable but are not captured by a given
model [47]. Typically, scientific regret minimization requires the collection of a largescale experiment-specific data set to train this predictive model. Centaur, on the other
hand, can be used out-of-the-box and without the need to collect any domain-specific
data, thereby circumventing this step and broadening the scope of scientific regret
minimization considerably (indeed, the multi-attribute decision-making data set under
consideration contains less than a hundred participants, placing it far out of reach
for traditional scientific regret minimization). When inspecting the responses that are
well-predicted by Centaur but not the DeepSeek-R1-discovered model, we observed
that they all involve choices in which participants choose the option with fewer positive ratings overall but which was rated positively by a higher validity expert. This
pattern suggests that the switch between the two heuristics is likely not as strict as initially suggested by the DeepSeek-R1-discovered strategy. To capture this, we replaced
the either-or rule with a weighted average of both heuristics. We found that the model
that resulted from this process matched Centaur in terms of its goodness-of-fit (AIC:
71.7) while still being interpretable. Notably, the final result of this model comparison stands in contrast to the one that was conducted with the original set of models
and indicates that people rely on a combination of heuristics when making decisions
as opposed to following a weighted-additive strategy [48].

Discussion
The present paper introduced Centaur, the first foundation model of human cognition.
We obtained Centaur by finetuning a state-of-the-art language model on Psych-101 – a
novel, large-scale data set of human behavior. This approach allowed us to leverage the
vast knowledge embedded in large language models, while, at the same time, aligning
them with human behavior [15]. Centaur successfully captures human behavior and
passes a wide range of out-of-distribution checks. It generalizes not only to unseen
participants but also to new cover stories, structural variations, and entirely novel
domains. In addition to analyzing the model on a behavioral level, we also conducted
a series of analyses on its internal representations, in which we found an increased
alignment with human neural activity.
We furthermore conducted a case study demonstrating how both Psych-101 and
Centaur can be used for guiding the development of predictive, yet interpretable,
cognitive models. Looking beyond this example, Centaur finds many additional applications in the context of automated cognitive science [49–51]. It may, for instance, be
used for in-silico prototyping of experimental studies [52]. In this context, one could
use the model to figure out which designs lead to the largest effect sizes, how to design
a study to reduce the number of required participants, or to estimate the power of an
effect.

11

While the present paper takes initial steps in leveraging Centaur to gain deeper
insights into human cognition, it also opens up exciting new avenues for future exploration. First, one could further probe Centaur’s internal representations to understand
how it represents knowledge and processes information. The resulting insights could,
in turn, be used to generate new hypotheses about knowledge representation and information processing in humans that could be validated in future experimental studies.
We believe that tools like sparse autoencoders [53] and attention map visualization
[54] provide promising avenues towards accomplishing this goal and hope to explore
them in future studies.
In addition, it might also be possible to train models with different architectures
from scratch using the data set that we have created in the process of this paper.
Doing so would enable us to investigate the neural architecture of human cognition at
a scale that could not have been done before. We might, for example, ask questions
such as whether human information processing is better described by attention-based
architectures [55] or architectures with a vector-based memory [56], or how much we
can improve by incorporating theories from the neuroscience literature [57, 58]. We
expect an eventual outcome of such an approach to contain both domain-specific and
domain-general modules, thereby allowing us to investigate the interplay between the
two.
Even though Psych-101 is already the broadest and largest data set of human
behavior out there, we view its development as an ongoing process and plan to further
develop it. The focus in its current state is largely on learning and decision-making,
but eventually, we intend to include additional domains such as psycholinguistics,
social psychology, and economic games. Experiments with information about individual differences are another source of neglected data in the current iteration of
Psych-101. Ideally, we want to include all types of relevant information about subjects (e.g., age, personality traits, or socioeconomic status) in the prompt, such
that a model trained on this data can capture individual differences. Experiments
from developmental psychology or computational psychiatry provide an ideal source
for this purpose. Finally, while we have already included some cross-cultural and
meta-studies [59–62], the current iteration has still a strong bias toward a Western,
educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) population [63]. To address
all of these shortcomings, we have created an open-source repository and invite
everyone to contribute to the next iteration of Psych-101 in an open research collaboration (https://github.com/marcelbinz/Psych-201). The goal of this effort is to provide
psychological data in a standardized format that facilitates benchmarking, thereby
complementing existing efforts from the neuroscience community [64–67]. While the
natural language format (together with quite a bit of reverse-engineering) used in this
work allows us to express a vast range of experimental paradigms, it introduces a
selection bias against experiments that cannot be expressed in natural language. The
long-term objective should be to move towards a multi-modal data format instead [68].

Conclusion
When the idea of a unified model of cognition was first proposed, researchers expressed
concern that established areas of cognitive science might react negatively to such a
model. In particular, they feared that the new approach might be seen as unfamiliar or
incompatible with existing theories, just like an “intruder with improper pheromones”
[69]. This could lead to an “attack of the killer bees”, where researchers in traditional fields would fiercely critique or reject the new model to defend their established
approaches. To mitigate these concerns, the concept of a cognitive decathlon was
proposed: a rigorous evaluation framework in which competing models of cognition
are tested across ten experiments and judged based on their cumulative performance
in them. In the current work, we applied Centaur to the equivalent of sixteen such
cognitive decathlons, where it was tested against numerous established models and
consistently won every competition. This outcome suggests that the data-driven discovery of domain-general models of cognition is a promising research direction. The
next step for future research should be to translate this domain-general computational
model into a unified theory of human cognition as envisioned by Newell [2].

Methods
Data collection
We constructed Psych-101 by transcribing data from 160 psychological experiments
into natural language. Each prompt was designed to include the entire trial-by-trial
history of a complete session from a single participant. The included experiments were
selected using the following criteria: (a) publicly available data on a trial-by-trial level,
(b) possibility of transcription into text without a significant loss of information, and
(c) coverage of a broad spectrum of domains. The transcription of each experiment
was done manually by the authors. We designed our natural language prompts using
the following principles: (a) instructions follow the original study as closely as possible,
(b) simplifications were made where appropriate, and (c) a maximum prompt length
of roughly 32,768 tokens. Full information about all included experiments is provided
in the Supplementary Information.

Finetuning procedure
We used Llama 3.1 70B as the base model for our finetuning procedure. We relied
on a parameter-efficient finetuning technique known as QLoRA [19]. QLoRA adds
so-called low-rank adapters to each layer of a four-bit quantized base model. The
base model was kept fixed during finetuning and only the parameters of the low-rank
adapters were adjusted. We added low-rank adapters to all linear layers of the selfattention mechanisms and the feedforward networks. Each low-rank adapter modifies
the forward pass as follows:
Y = XW + αXL1 L2

W ∈ Rh×o ; L1 ∈ Rh×r ; L2 ∈ Rr×o

where XW is the (quantized) linear transformation of the base model and XL1 L2
the low-rank adapter. The hyperparameter α controls the trade-off between the two.
Low-rank adapter computations are performed in half-precision floating-point format.
For further details on this technique, we refer the reader to [19].
We finetuned the model for one epoch on the entire data set using a standard
cross-entropy loss (we experimented with prolonged training but found that this led
to overfitting). We only backpropagated the loss at human responses and masked out
the loss for all other tokens. The effective batch size was set to 32, the learning rate
to 0.00005, and the weight decay to 0.01. We used an 8-bit AdamW optimizer [70]
with a linearly increasing warm up over the first 100 gradient steps. The finetuning
procedure was implemented using the unsloth library (https://unsloth.ai/).
We have also trained a smaller version of Centaur – called Minitaur – that uses
Llama 3.1 8B as base model following the same recipe. Minitaur captures human
behavior close to its training distribution but generalizes less robustly than the larger
model to out-of-distribution experiments. Nevertheless, we believe that Mintaur is
useful for prototyping as it does not require access to any specific hardware (it runs,
for instance, on the free GPU instances in Google Colab). More detailed results for
this model are provided in the Supplementary Information.

Evaluation metric
We use (negative) log-likelihoods averaged over responses as our evaluation metric. For
experiments with multi-token responses, we summed log-likelihoods within a response
and averaged across responses.

Domain-specific cognitive models
We selected 14 cognitive and statistical models that together cover most of the experiments in Psych-101 as our baseline models. Further details regarding the included
models and their specifications are provided in the Supplementary Information.
For our main analysis, we were interested in predicting the behavior of held-out
participants. Therefore, we fitted a joint set of parameters for all participants in
the training data and evaluated how well a model with these parameters predicts
responses of held-out participants. Mirroring the evaluation metric for the languagebased models, we evaluated goodness-of-fit using (negative) log-likelihoods averaged
over responses.
For the out-of-distribution evaluations, we fitted model parameters using the most
similar experiment in the training set, and then evaluated how well a model with
the resulting parameters predicts human responses in the unseen setting. The most
similar experiment for the magical carpet version of the two-step task was a two-step
task experiment with the default spaceship cover story. The most similar experiment
for Maggie’s farm was the horizon task. We included no baseline model for the logical
reasoning task, as none of the experiments in the training data were similar to it.

Neural alignment
The neural alignment analysis on the two-step task was conducted using data collected in a previous study [41]. We used a regularized linear regression model to
predict fMRI data from internal representations of Centaur and Llama (a separate
model was used for each participant and region). We fitted each of these models on
data from two scanning blocks and evaluated them on data from the third. The regularization strength was selected using a nested cross-validation procedure. For each
run, we split the beta maps into cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROI)
using the Schaefer 2018 atlas [71]. We averaged the betas within each ROI, reducing
the number of betas from the number of voxels to the number of ROIs. All cortical
and subcortical ROIs from the atlas were evaluated. Reported Pearson correlation
coefficients correspond to the average across all ROIs.
Internal representations were extracted from the models’ residual stream and
transformed using a principal component analysis. We set the number of retained
components such that they explain 95% of the variance.
The fMRI data were preprocessed using fMRIPrep 24.0 [72]. We used the default
settings of fMRIPrep, and all the scans were aligned to the MNI152NLin2009cAsym
atlas [73]. To extract effect estimates for each subtrial of the task (e.g., second step
of the fifth trial, feedback of the tenth trial), we built separate general linear models
(GLMs). Each GLM included the subtrial of interest as a separate regressor, whose
z-scored beta estimates were used for the alignment analysis. This part of the data
15

was not modeled using other regressors. Additionally, we included different regressors
capturing all the first steps, all the second steps, and all the feedback steps. Lastly, we
used 6 rotation and translation estimates as well as framewise displacement as noise
regressors. The hemodynamic response was modeled using the spm [74] model. A high
pass filter of 0.01 Hz and a Gaussian kernel with 6mm full-width at half-maximum
was applied. The GLMs were built using nilearn [75].
The neural alignment analysis on the sentence-reading task was conducted using
publicly available code from the original study [42]. No other changes were made
besides replacing GPT2-XL with Centaur and Llama. We refer the reader to [42] for
further details.

Model-guided scientific discovery
In our model-guided scientific discovery analysis, we focused on participants in the
test set to avoid any potential contamination issues. We fitted parameters of all cognitive models individually for each participant using a maximum likelihood estimation.
Models were compared against each other using the Akaike information criterion
(AIC). The three models from the original study were implemented via the following
equations:
⊤
p(a = A|xA , xB , WADD) ∝ exp β · wWADD
xA



wWADD = [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6]

⊤
p(a = A|xA , xB , EW) ∝ exp β · wEW
xA
wEW = [1, 1, 1, 1]
⊤
p(a = A|xA , xB , TTB) ∝ exp β · wTTB
xA



wTTB = [1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125]
where xA and xB are vectors containing four expert ratings (either 0 or 1) and β is a
free parameter controlling the noise level.
We prompted DeepSeek-R1 (in the Distill-Llama-70B variant) to generate explanations of human decision-making; the corresponding prompt is provided in the
Supplementary Information. We then formalized the explanation shown in Figure 5
into the following computational model:

(
p(a = A|xA , xB , DeepSeek-R1) ∝

⊤
exp β · wTTB
xA

⊤
exp β · wEW
xA

P

if
i xA,i =
i xB,i

For the scientific regret minimization pipeline, we computed the difference in loglikelihoods between Centaur and the DeepSeek-R1-discovered model. We visualized
and inspected the ten data points with the highest difference. This process resulted in
the following computational model:
⊤
⊤
p(a = A|xA , xB , SRM) ∝ exp β · σ · wTTB
xA + (1 − σ) · wEW

where σ is a free parameter constrained between 0 and 1 controlling the trade-off
between the two strategies.

Data contamination analysis
We performed a data contamination analysis using the LogProber method proposed in
[76]. LogProber fits the following two-parameter exponential model to the cumulative
log-likelihood of each sequence being checked for contamination:
f (x) = −A 1 − e−Bx



logB

Prompts that are memorized from the pretraining data will show a high acceleration (B). Following the results presented in [76], we set a threshold for possible
contamination to log B ≥ 1. We repeat this analysis for each experiment in Psych-101.
For this, we used prompts up to the point of the first human choice. This analysis
indicated no evidence of contamination as shown in Figure 7.

Experiment embeddings
Figure 8 shows a two-dimensional embedding of the experiments used in this paper. To
obtain this embedding, we took the corresponding natural language prompts up to the
point of the first human choice, extracted a vector-based representation for them using
ModernBERT [77], and finally projected these representations onto two dimensions
using multidimensional scaling. We observed that most of our out-of-distribution evaluation experiments are placed on the boundaries of the embedding space, confirming
that they indeed probe the generalization abilities of Centaur.

Further out-of-distribution evaluations
Figure 10 contains results for six additional out-of-distribution experimental
paradigms, including moral decision-making [31], economic games [32], naturalistic
category and reward learning [33], behavioral propensities [34], and a deep sequential
decision task [35]. None of these paradigms were included in Psych-101, hence they
provide a stress test for a model’s generalization capabilities. Centaur robustly captured human behavior in all of these settings, while smaller and non-finetuned models
did not do so consistently.

Further model comparisons
To rule out the hypothesis that finetuning on any data aligns a model with human
behavior, we compared Centaur to various Llama variants finetuned for other purposes
(i.e. non-cognitive tasks). These models include the following:
• Nemotron [78]: finetuned for instruction-following.
• Hermes [79]: finetuned for various purposes, including agentic capabilities, roleplaying, reasoning, multi-turn conversation, and long context coherence.
• Reflection: finetuned for reasoning.
Figure 11 illustrates the results of this analysis. We observed that none of the
Llama variants captures human behavior better than the base model, ruling out the
hypothesis that finetuning generally leads to models that are better at predicting
human behavior.

Noise ceiling analysis
We conducted a noise ceiling analysis to better understand the capabilities of Centaur.
It is not straightforward to estimate the noise ceiling for experiments with sequential
dependencies, which includes the majority of Psych-101. Hence, we focused on two
experiments for which such an analysis is possible: the choices13k data set [21] and
an intertemporal choice experiment [59]. In both cases, we found that Centaur substantially exceeds the estimated noise ceiling. This is possible because Centaur can
pick up on context-dependent patterns that are not captured by standard noise ceiling analyses. Therefore, we have performed an additional analysis testing how well
Centaur can predict human responses if we prompt it to predict each response independently. We use the suffix “ind.” to indicate this way of prompting the model.
Centaur still matches the performance of domain-specific cognitive models when
context-independent prompts are used, amounting to roughly half of the estimated
noise ceiling. Figure 12 visualizes these results.

metabench
Figure 13 shows additional results in metabench, a sparse benchmark containing several canonical benchmarks from the machine learning literature [38]. We find that
Centaur maintains the level of performance of Llama, indicating that finetuning on
human behavior did not lead to deterioration in other tasks. Performance on TruthfulQA [80] – which measures how models mimic human falsehoods – even improved
significantly with finetuning. We refer the reader to [38] for further details.

Fine-grained neural analysis results
Figure 15 shows fine-grained neural alignment results on the two-step task data. Centaur achieves the most accurate predictions in the left motor cortex (see Figure 15a).
As participants performed the task with their right hand in the scanner, this effect
may be explained by Centaur’s strong performance in predicting choices.
Figure 15b contains numerical results for ROIs that have been identified as behaviorally relevant in previous work. Centaur outperformed Llama and the cognitive
model in predicting activity in accumbens, the ROI from the original study that
showed a reward prediction error effect [22, 41]. We found a similar pattern in the
medial PFC, another region that showed an effect in the original article [41], as well
as in the sensory and motor cortices.

Table 2 Newell test for a theory of cognition.

Model-guided scientific discovery
We generated an explanation for the behavior of every participant in the multiattribute decision-making study of [46] using DeepSeek-R1 based on the following
prompt template:
In the following, you will see a transcript of a psychological experiment. Participant
responses are highlighted within “<<” and “>>” characters. Your job will be
to explain what strategies that participant used to solve the given task. Your
explanation should be targeted at an expert cognitive scientist.
### START OF TRANSCRIPT ###
[TRANSCRIPT]
### END OF TRANSCRIPT ###
Please explain what strategies that participant used to solve the given task in less
than two hundred words:

Newell test
Together with his call for unified theories of cognition [2, 81], Newell outlined a set of
criteria that a unified computational model should fulfill. Centaur is the first model
to satisfy the majority of these criteria (see Table 2). Most importantly, it (1) behaves
as an almost arbitrary function of the environment, (2) operates in real time, and
(3) relies on vast amounts of knowledge about the world. We provide an extended
discussion on Newell’s criteria in the following.

Behave as an (almost) arbitrary function of the environment
This is the most important criterion according to Newell. Centaur fulfills it more than
any previous model as shown by our extensive analysis. Yet, Centaur’s scope is still
limited to psychological experiments that can be expressed in natural language. It

26

will be an important avenue for future research to transfer this ability to real-world
applications.

Operate in real time
Centaur can simulate human behavior in (almost) real-time. For example, running an
open-loop simulation of a typical two-step task experiment takes around 30 minutes,
while it takes around 20 minutes for the average human participant. We believe that
inference time could be further optimized to fully close this gap.

Exhibit rational, that is, effective adaptive behavior
Bayesian inference is the gold standard for rational and adaptive behavior [82]. Previous work has shown that systems that engage in in-context learning implement
Bayesian inference implicitly [83]. In-context learning is at the heart of Centaur,
thereby making it a rational and adaptive system.

Use vast amounts of knowledge about the environment
Large language models are the biggest knowledge bases we have to date. As Centaur
is built on top of a state-of-the-art language model, it fulfills this criterion by design.

Behave robustly in the face of error, the unexpected, and the
unknown
Our extensive out-of-distribution evaluations clearly demonstrate that Centaur has
this ability.

Integrate diverse knowledge
This was originally a criterion on symbols and abstractions [2]. At the basic level,
Centaur is a system that processes language. Language is a symbolic system, meaning
that Centaur fulfills this criterion.

Use (natural) language
No further elaboration is required.

Exhibit self-awareness and a sense of self
This is a tricky criterion as Centaur is trained on a population of individuals. Yet,
to make good predictions about the future, Centaur needs to make inferences about
the person who has produced a given trajectory, and in order to do that it requires a
representation of that person [84].

Learn from its environment
Psych-101 contains many experiments that require learning from an environment.
Centaur does well in those experiments, thereby clearly satisfying this criterion.
27

Acquire capabilities through development
Centaur makes no claims about how human behavior might arise through development.

Arise through evolution
Centaur makes no claims about how human behavior might arise through evolution.

Be realizable within the brain
We have shown that Centaur’s internal representations are robust predictors of human
neural activity. Even though there is clearly a gap between the transformer architecture
that Centaur is based on and the human brain, Centaur still represents the current
state-of-the-art when looking at neural alignment to human subjects.

Modeling details
In the following, we list the domain-specific cognitive and statistical models used in
our comparison. Each model was implemented in PyTorch [85]. We optimized a joint
set of parameters for all participants in the training data by maximizing log-likelihoods
of their choices and then evaluated how well a model with these parameters predicts
choices of held-out participants. The optimization procedure involved 1000 iterations
over the entire training set, and relied on a gradient-based algorithm [86] with an
initial learning rate of 0.1. We use 1 to denote the indicator function that takes a
value of one if the argument is true and zero otherwise.

Each day you will either be presented with spaceships G and S or with spaceships T
and N.
These spaceships will take you to two different planets R and Z.
You can take a spaceship by pressing the corresponding key.
Each planet has one alien on it and each alien has its own space treasure mine.
When you arrive at a planet, you will ask the alien for space treasure from its mine.
When you ask the alien, you will find out whether you got space treasure.

Number of choices: 499728
Example prompt:
You will play multiple rounds of a gambling game.
In each round, you will be presented with 6 different gambles labeled: Q, N, E, S, H,
and K.
You will have to choose one of the gambles and receive a payoff for doing so.
The payoff you receive depends on both the gamble you choose and also the color of
a ball we pull out of a jar with 100 colored balls.
There are a different number of balls of each color on every round.
The colors with more balls are more likely to be chosen.

You are playing a game where you are revealing patterns on a binary grid.
Each turn you will be presented with a 7x7 grid of tiles.
If you give the location on the grid with an ”X” on it, then it will either turn into a
”1” or a ”0”.
Please give the location as a [row, column] pair where both row and column take
values between 0 and 6.
Do not give the location on the grid where there is already a ”1” or a ”0”.
Your job is to reveal as many 1s as possible while revealing as little 0s as possible.
The game ends when you have revealed all 1s on the grid.
You will have 25 boards to complete, each with a different underlying pattern.

Medin categorization
Data source: [108]
Number of experiments: 2
Number of participants: 228
Number of choices: 37848
Example prompt:
You will observe a series of objects, one at a time.
The objects differ along three binary dimensions: shape (square vs. triangle), size (1.50
inch vs. 0.75 inch), and shading (black vs. white).
Each dimension is indicated by the three digits, for example, ’121’ means a square,
0.75 inch, black object.
Based on some combination of the three dimensions, each object belongs to one of two
categories, W or N.
You have to assign each object to one of the two categories by pressing the corresponding key.
If your choice is correct, you get a point, otherwise you lose a point.
Your goal is to get as many points as possible.

88

At some point, you begin a ’test block’ in which you will see eight objects.
Here, you have to assign each object to one of the two categories as before.
Furthermore, you have to rate how typical the object is for the category you chose,
on a scale from 1 to 9.
1 means ’not at all typical’, and 9 means ’most typical’.

Number of choices: 34442
Example prompt:
You will have to repeatedly feed animals with fruits.
Each fruit contains two vitamins.
Every animal has a different preference for the vitamins.
The vitamin contents and the preferences are both given as vectors with two entries.
Your points are calculated as the dot product of the vitamin content with the preference of the current animal.
For example, let us assume that you have to feed the elephant who has a preference
[-1 1].
Then, if you feed the elephant a fruit with vitamin content [-1 1], this would yield 2
points.
If you feed it a fruit with vitamins [1 0], this would yield -1 points.
You have to buy the fruits in a market, in which you can go left or right for two steps.
You can press I to go left, and V to go right.
Per round, you always collect two fruits.
There are eight animals in total and you have to feed one, two, or three of them in

90

each block.
In each block, there are twelve trials with different animals in random order.
After these twelve trials, there are three more in which you have to feed new animals.
The fruits in the market are rearranged after each block, meaning that you have to
relearn the positions.
Your goal is to maximize the points obtained.
A new block starts. The locations of the fruits in the market got scrambled.

Aversive learning
Data source: [119]
Number of experiments: 1
Number of participants: 57
Number of choices: 18240
Example prompt:
You are going to predict the probability of electric shocks associated with two visual
stimuli.
First, you will have to indicate the probability that a stimulus predicts a shock at the
current moment in time on a rating bar (between 0 and 100 percent).

118

After that, the outcome for each stimulus will be presented visually.
An upcoming shock will be indicated by a square over the stimulus, while a no-shock
outcome will be indicated by a circle.
Finally, shocks will be delivered after you have learned about the outcome visually.
If both stimuli indicate a shock, they will be presented one after the other in random
order.
The shock probability fluctuates over time such that one stimulus has a stable probability while the other varies.
Stimulus J and K are shown on the screen. You predict that the shock probability for
stimulus J is <<50.0>>% and the shock probability for stimulus K is <<50.0>>%.
After that, a circle is shown over stimulus J, and a square is shown over stimulus K.
Finally, a shock is delivered for stimulus K.
Stimulus J and K are shown on the screen. You predict that the shock probability for
stimulus J is <<50.0>>% and the shock probability for stimulus K is <<59.33>>%.
After that, a square is shown over stimulus J, and a circle is shown over stimulus K.
Finally, a shock is delivered for stimulus J.

Data source: [94]
Number of experiments: 1
Number of participants: 78
Number of choices: 9360
Example prompt:
You will be presented with a series of 16 different environments to explore.
In each trial, you can select an option between numbers 1 and 30 by pressing the corresponding key.
By selecting any of these options, you will earn points associated with each unique
option.
Imagine these options 1 through 30 as lying next to each other in an ordered line;
options closer to each other tend to have similar rewards as rewards tend to cluster
together.
For each environment, you will be able to make either 5 or 10 choices.
When you made all your choices in a given environment, you will start making choices
in the next unexplored environment.
The rewards underlying the different options are different in each environment so you
will learn them anew for each environment.
Each environment starts with the value of a single option revealed.
When you choose the number corresponding to a different option, you will be told the
value of that option and receive those points.
Previously revealed options, including the starting option, can also be reselected,
although there may be small changes in the point value.
It is your task to gain as many points as possible across all 16 environments.

Example prompt:
You are participating in multiple games involving two slot machines, labeled M and
V.
The two slot machines are different in different games.
Each time you choose a slot machine, you get points (choosing the same slot machine
will not always give you the same points).
You select a slot machine by pressing the corresponding key.
The expected points change randomly, abruptly, and independently with a hazard rate
(which you will be told).
When the points change, the new expected point value assigned to that slot machine
is sampled from a uniform distribution (from 1 to 99 points).
For example, if the hazard rate is 0.1, the expected points of the machines change
with 10%.
Your goal is to choose the slot machine that will give you the most points.
Game 1. The hazard rate is 0.1. There are 100 trials in this game.

Example prompt:
You are participating in a space treasure game.
In this game, you will be visiting two alien planets in search of treasure.
Each planet has two aliens on it.
The blue aliens live on the blue planet.
The red aliens live on the red planet.
When you visit a planet, you can choose an alien to trade with by pressing the corresponding button.
When you trade with an alien, it will either give you treasure or junk.
Your goal is to figure out, and trade with, the aliens that are most likely to give you
treasure.
To visit a planet, you will choose one rocket ship from two by pressing the corresponding button.
They have different designations.
Each rocket ship has a planet it will fly to most of the time.
But sometimes they will take you to the other planet!
Remember the following hints:
1. How likely an alien is to give you treasure will change over time, but this change
will be slow.
2. Whether you get treasure depends only on the alien you choose to trade with.
3. If there is an alien you want to trade with, remember to pick the rocket ship that

Example prompt:
You are playing the role of a musician living in a fantasy land.
You play the flute for gold coins to an audience of genies, who live inside magic lamps
on Pink Mountain and Blue Mountain.
Pink Mountain has genies H and J, and Blue Mountain has genies A and E.
Each genie lives in a lamp with the corresponding letter on it.
When you arrive on a mountain, you can pick up a lamp and rub it.
If the genie is in the mood for music, he will come out of his lamp, listen to a song,
and give you a gold coin.
Each genie’s interest in music changes with time.
To go to the mountains, you chose one of two magic carpets, which you purchase from
a magician, who enchants them to fly.
Magic carpet K generally flies to Pink Mountain, and magic carpet O generally flies
to Blue Mountain.
However, on rare occasions a strong wind blowing from that mountain makes flying
there too dangerous because the wind might blow you off the carpet.
In this case, the carpet is forced to land instead on the other mountain.
You can take a magic carpet or pick up a lamp and rub it by pressing the corresponding
key.
Your goal is to get as many coins as possible over the next 201 days.
