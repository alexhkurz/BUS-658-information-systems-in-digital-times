## Summary

The paper introduces Tri-System Theory, extending dual-process accounts of reasoning by positing System 3: artificial cognition that operates outside the brain and can supplement or supplant internal processes. A key prediction is “cognitive surrender”—adopting AI outputs with minimal scrutiny, overriding intuition (System 1) and deliberation (System 2). Across three preregistered experiments using an adapted Cognitive Reflection Test (N = 1,372; 9,593 trials), participants chose to consult an AI assistant on a majority of trials. Relative to baseline (no System 3 access), accuracy rose when AI was accurate and fell when it erred (+25/-15 percentage points; behavioural signature of cognitive surrender). Engaging System 3 also increased confidence, even following errors. Time pressure and incentives shifted baseline performance but did not eliminate this pattern. Participants with higher trust in AI and lower need for cognition and fluid intelligence showed greater surrender to System 3. Tri-System Theory characterises a triadic cognitive ecology and how System 3 reframes human reasoning, autonomy, and accountability in the age of AI.

## Relevance to our class

- **Human–AI reasoning**: how AI is integrated into decision-making; cognitive surrender vs cognitive offloading.
- **Dual-process and Tri-System**: extension of Kahneman-style System 1/2 to System 3 (artificial cognition).
- **Autonomy and accountability**: when reasoning is outsourced to AI.

## Key concepts

- **Tri-System Theory**, System 3 (artificial cognition), cognitive surrender, cognitive offloading, Cognitive Reflection Test, trust in AI, need for cognition.
