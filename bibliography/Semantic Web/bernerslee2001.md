## Summary

This influential Scientific American article introduces the vision of the Semantic Web: a web of content that is meaningful to computers, not only to humans. The authors describe a future in which software agents can reason over structured, machine-readable data—combining information from diverse sources (e.g. doctors, insurers, calendars) to perform tasks such as scheduling appointments, checking eligibility, and finding providers. The article uses a scenario in which Pete and Lucy use Semantic Web agents to coordinate their mother's care. It argues that adding semantics (formal definitions of meaning) to web content will "unleash a revolution of new possibilities" by enabling automated discovery, combination, and use of information. The piece helped define the research agenda for the Semantic Web, linked data, and ontologies.

## Relevance to our project

### Information Systems and Meaning
- Classic vision of machine-readable meaning on the web
- Contrast with later data-driven (e.g. LLM) approaches that learn from text without explicit semantics
- Relevant to history of AI, knowledge representation, and the web

### Agents and Automation
- Describes agents that act on behalf of users using shared, structured data
- Connects to themes of agents, automation, and human–machine coordination
- Relevant to discussions of LLM-based agents vs. symbolically structured systems

## Key concepts

- **Semantic Web**: Extension of the web where content has formally defined meaning for machines
- **Ontologies**: Formal specifications of concepts and relationships
- **Software agents**: Programs that perform tasks by combining and reasoning over structured data

## Notes

The Semantic Web vision predates the current LLM era. Tension between this symbolic, ontology-driven approach and statistical/language-model approaches is a recurring theme in AI and information systems. The article remains a key reference for linked data, RDF, and knowledge graphs.
