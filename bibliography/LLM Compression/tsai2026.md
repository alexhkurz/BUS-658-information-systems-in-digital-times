## Summary

This report revisits the use of large language models for data compression. It builds on prior work that applied LLMs to text and multi-modal data and focuses on reducing the adjusted compression rate and improving performance on different encodings (including byte-stream). The author shows that the memory footprint of existing LLMs can be reduced while keeping similar compression levels, achieving a new state-of-the-art adjusted compression rate (e.g. nearly 18%) without extra training. LLMs are shown to be strong compressors for text-dominant data and to remain competitive on non-text data when configured appropriately.

## Relevance to our class

- **Efficiency vs capability**: compressing the compressor (smaller LMs) while preserving compression performance.
- **Generalisation**: LLMs as compressors across text and non-text data.
- **Practical deployment**: adjusted compression rate and memory footprint as design criteria.

## Key concepts

- **Adjusted compression rate**, LLM compression, byte-stream encoding, memory footprint, state-of-the-art compression.
