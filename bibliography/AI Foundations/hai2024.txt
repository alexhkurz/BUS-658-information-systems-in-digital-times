Introduction to the
AI Index Report 2024
Welcome to the seventh edition of the AI Index report. The 2024 Index is our most comprehensive to date and
arrives at an important moment when AI’s influence on society has never been more pronounced. This year,
we have broadened our scope to more extensively cover essential trends such as technical advancements
in AI, public perceptions of the technology, and the geopolitical dynamics surrounding its development.
Featuring more original data than ever before, this edition introduces new estimates on AI training costs,
detailed analyses of the responsible AI landscape, and an entirely new chapter dedicated to AI’s impact on
science and medicine.
The AI Index report tracks, collates, distills, and visualizes data related to artificial intelligence (AI). Our
mission is to provide unbiased, rigorously vetted, broadly sourced data in order for policymakers, researchers,
executives, journalists, and the general public to develop a more thorough and nuanced understanding of the
complex field of AI.
The AI Index is recognized globally as one of the most credible and authoritative sources for data and insights
on artificial intelligence. Previous editions have been cited in major newspapers, including the The New York
Times, Bloomberg, and The Guardian, have amassed hundreds of academic citations, and been referenced
by high-level policymakers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, among
other places. This year’s edition surpasses all previous ones in size, scale, and scope, reflecting the growing
significance that AI is coming to hold in all of our lives.

Message From
the Co-directors
A decade ago, the best AI systems in the world were unable to classify objects in images at a human level. AI
struggled with language comprehension and could not solve math problems. Today, AI systems routinely exceed
human performance on standard benchmarks.
Progress accelerated in 2023. New state-of-the-art systems like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude 3 are impressively
multimodal: They can generate fluent text in dozens of languages, process audio, and even explain memes. As AI
has improved, it has increasingly forced its way into our lives. Companies are racing to build AI-based products,
and AI is increasingly being used by the general public. But current AI technology still has significant problems. It
cannot reliably deal with facts, perform complex reasoning, or explain its conclusions.
AI faces two interrelated futures. First, technology continues to improve and is increasingly used, having major
consequences for productivity and employment. It can be put to both good and bad uses. In the second future,
the adoption of AI is constrained by the limitations of the technology. Regardless of which future unfolds,
governments are increasingly concerned. They are stepping in to encourage the upside, such as funding university
R&D and incentivizing private investment. Governments are also aiming to manage the potential downsides, such
as impacts on employment, privacy concerns, misinformation, and intellectual property rights.
As AI rapidly evolves, the AI Index aims to help the AI community, policymakers, business leaders, journalists, and
the general public navigate this complex landscape. It provides ongoing, objective snapshots tracking several
key areas: technical progress in AI capabilities, the community and investments driving AI development and
deployment, public opinion on current and potential future impacts, and policy measures taken to stimulate AI
innovation while managing its risks and challenges. By comprehensively monitoring the AI ecosystem, the Index
serves as an important resource for understanding this transformative technological force.
On the technical front, this year’s AI Index reports that the number of new large language models released
worldwide in 2023 doubled over the previous year. Two-thirds were open-source, but the highest-performing
models came from industry players with closed systems. Gemini Ultra became the first LLM to reach humanlevel performance on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark; performance on the
benchmark has improved by 15 percentage points since last year. Additionally, GPT-4 achieved an impressive 0.96
mean win rate score on the comprehensive Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) benchmark, which
includes MMLU among other evaluations.

Message From the
Co-directors (cont’d)
Although global private investment in AI decreased for the second consecutive year, investment in generative
AI skyrocketed. More Fortune 500 earnings calls mentioned AI than ever before, and new studies show that AI
tangibly boosts worker productivity. On the policymaking front, global mentions of AI in legislative proceedings
have never been higher. U.S. regulators passed more AI-related regulations in 2023 than ever before. Still, many
expressed concerns about AI’s ability to generate deepfakes and impact elections. The public became more
aware of AI, and studies suggest that they responded with nervousness.

Index Report 2024

Top 10 Takeaways
1. AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. AI has surpassed human performance on several
benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails
behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning.

2. Industry continues to dominate frontier AI research. In 2023, industry produced 51 notable
machine learning models, while academia contributed only 15. There were also 21 notable models resulting from
industry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high.

3. Frontier models get way more expensive. According to AI Index estimates, the training costs
of state-of-the-art AI models have reached unprecedented levels. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 used an
estimated $78 million worth of compute to train, while Google’s Gemini Ultra cost $191 million for compute.

4. The United States leads China, the EU, and the U.K. as the leading source of top AI
models. In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from U.S.-based institutions, far outpacing the European
Union’s 21 and China’s 15.

5. Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking.
New research from the AI Index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting.
Leading developers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, primarily test their models against different
responsible AI benchmarks. This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and
limitations of top AI models.

6. Generative AI investment skyrockets. Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last
year, funding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. Major players in
the generative AI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial
fundraising rounds.

7. The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work. In
2023, several studies assessed AI’s impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks more
quickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI’s potential to bridge
the skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still, other studies caution that using AI without proper
oversight can lead to diminished performance.

8. Scientific progress accelerates even further, thanks to AI. In 2022, AI began to advance
scientific discovery. 2023, however, saw the launch of even more significant science-related AI applications—
from AlphaDev, which makes algorithmic sorting more efficient, to GNoME, which facilitates the process of
materials discovery.

9. The number of AI regulations in the United States sharply increases. The number of AIrelated regulations in the U.S. has risen significantly in the past year and over the last five years. In 2023, there
were 25 AI-related regulations, up from just one in 2016. Last year alone, the total number of AI-related regulations
grew by 56.3%.

10. People across the globe are more cognizant of AI’s potential impact—and more nervous.
A survey from Ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think AI will dramatically affect their
lives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. Moreover, 52% express nervousness toward AI
products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. In America, Pew data suggests that 52% of
Americans report feeling more concerned than excited about AI, rising from 37% in 2022.

Report Highlights
Chapter 1: Research and Development
1. Industry continues to dominate frontier AI research. In 2023, industry produced 51 notable
machine learning models, while academia contributed only 15. There were also 21 notable models resulting from
industry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high.

2. More foundation models and more open foundation models. In 2023, a total of 149 foundation
models were released, more than double the amount released in 2022. Of these newly released models, 65.7%
were open-source, compared to only 44.4% in 2022 and 33.3% in 2021.

3. Frontier models get way more expensive. According to AI Index estimates, the training costs of
state-of-the-art AI models have reached unprecedented levels. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 used an estimated
$78 million worth of compute to train, while Google’s Gemini Ultra cost $191 million for compute.

4. The United States leads China, the EU, and the U.K. as the leading source of top AI
models. In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from U.S.-based institutions, far outpacing the European
Union’s 21 and China’s 15.

5. The number of AI patents skyrockets. From 2021 to 2022, AI patent grants worldwide increased
sharply by 62.7%. Since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.

6. China dominates AI patents. In 2022, China led global AI patent origins with 61.1%, significantly
outpacing the United States, which accounted for 20.9% of AI patent origins. Since 2010, the U.S. share of AI
patents has decreased from 54.1%.

7. Open-source AI research explodes. Since 2011, the number of AI-related projects on GitHub has
seen a consistent increase, growing from 845 in 2011 to approximately 1.8 million in 2023. Notably, there was a
sharp 59.3% rise in the total number of GitHub AI projects in 2023 alone. The total number of stars for AI-related
projects on GitHub also significantly increased in 2023, more than tripling from 4.0 million in 2022 to 12.2 million.

8. The number of AI publications continues to rise. Between 2010 and 2022, the total number of AI
publications nearly tripled, rising from approximately 88,000 in 2010 to more than 240,000 in 2022. The increase
over the last year was a modest 1.1%.

Report Highlights
Chapter 2: Technical Performance
1. AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. AI has surpassed human performance on several
benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails
behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning.

2. Here comes multimodal AI. Traditionally AI systems have been limited in scope, with language models
excelling in text comprehension but faltering in image processing, and vice versa. However, recent advancements
have led to the development of strong multimodal models, such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4. These
models demonstrate flexibility and are capable of handling images and text and, in some instances, can even
process audio.

3. Harder benchmarks emerge. AI models have reached performance saturation on established
benchmarks such as ImageNet, SQuAD, and SuperGLUE, prompting researchers to develop more challenging
ones. In 2023, several challenging new benchmarks emerged, including SWE-bench for coding, HEIM for image
generation, MMMU for general reasoning, MoCa for moral reasoning, AgentBench for agent-based behavior, and
HaluEval for hallucinations.

4. Better AI means better data which means … even better AI. New AI models such as
SegmentAnything and Skoltech are being used to generate specialized data for tasks like image segmentation and
3D reconstruction. Data is vital for AI technical improvements. The use of AI to create more data enhances current
capabilities and paves the way for future algorithmic improvements, especially on harder tasks.

5. Human evaluation is in. With generative models producing high-quality text, images, and more,
benchmarking has slowly started shifting toward incorporating human evaluations like the Chatbot Arena
Leaderboard rather than computerized rankings like ImageNet or SQuAD. Public sentiment about AI is becoming
an increasingly important consideration in tracking AI progress.

6. Thanks to LLMs, robots have become more flexible. The fusion of language modeling with
robotics has given rise to more flexible robotic systems like PaLM-E and RT-2. Beyond their improved robotic
capabilities, these models can ask questions, which marks a significant step toward robots that can interact more
effectively with the real world.

15

Artificial Intelligence
Index Report 2024

Chapter 2: Technical Performance (cont’d)
7. More technical research in agentic AI. Creating AI agents, systems capable of autonomous operation
in specific environments, has long challenged computer scientists. However, emerging research suggests that
the performance of autonomous AI agents is improving. Current agents can now master complex games like
Minecraft and effectively tackle real-world tasks, such as online shopping and research assistance.

8. Closed LLMs significantly outperform open ones. On 10 select AI benchmarks, closed models
outperformed open ones, with a median performance advantage of 24.2%. Differences in the performance of
closed and open models carry important implications for AI policy debates.

16

Artificial Intelligence
Index Report 2024

Report Highlights
Chapter 3: Responsible AI
1. Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking.
New research from the AI Index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting. Leading
developers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, primarily test their models against different responsible AI
benchmarks. This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations of top AI models.

2. Political deepfakes are easy to generate and difficult to detect. Political deepfakes are already
affecting elections across the world, with recent research suggesting that existing AI deepfake methods perform
with varying levels of accuracy. In addition, new projects like CounterCloud demonstrate how easily AI can create
and disseminate fake content.

3. Researchers discover more complex vulnerabilities in LLMs. Previously, most efforts to
red team AI models focused on testing adversarial prompts that intuitively made sense to humans. This year,
researchers found less obvious strategies to get LLMs to exhibit harmful behavior, like asking the models to
infinitely repeat random words.

4. Risks from AI are becoming a concern for businesses across the globe. A global survey on
responsible AI highlights that companies’ top AI-related concerns include privacy, data security, and reliability.
The survey shows that organizations are beginning to take steps to mitigate these risks. Globally, however, most
companies have so far only mitigated a small portion of these risks.

5. LLMs can output copyrighted material. Multiple researchers have shown that the generative outputs
of popular LLMs may contain copyrighted material, such as excerpts from The New York Times or scenes from
movies. Whether such output constitutes copyright violations is becoming a central legal question.

6. AI developers score low on transparency, with consequences for research. The newly
introduced Foundation Model Transparency Index shows that AI developers lack transparency, especially
regarding the disclosure of training data and methodologies. This lack of openness hinders efforts to further
understand the robustness and safety of AI systems.

17

Artificial Intelligence
Index Report 2024

Chapter 3: Responsible AI (cont’d)
7. Extreme AI risks are difficult to analyze. Over the past year, a substantial debate has emerged among
AI scholars and practitioners regarding the focus on immediate model risks, like algorithmic discrimination, versus
potential long-term existential threats. It has become challenging to distinguish which claims are scientifically
founded and should inform policymaking. This difficulty is compounded by the tangible nature of already present
short-term risks in contrast with the theoretical nature of existential threats.

8. The number of AI incidents continues to rise. According to the AI Incident Database, which tracks
incidents related to the misuse of AI, 123 incidents were reported in 2023, a 32.3 percentage point increase from
2022. Since 2013, AI incidents have grown by over twentyfold. A notable example includes AI-generated, sexually
explicit deepfakes of Taylor Swift that were widely shared online.

9. ChatGPT is politically biased. Researchers find a significant bias in ChatGPT toward Democrats in the
United States and the Labour Party in the U.K. This finding raises concerns about the tool’s potential to influence
users’ political views, particularly in a year marked by major global elections.

Report Highlights
Chapter 4: Economy
1. Generative AI investment skyrockets. Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last year,
funding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. Major players in the generative
AI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial fundraising rounds.

2. Already a leader, the United States pulls even further ahead in AI private investment.
In 2023, the United States saw AI investments reach $67.2 billion, nearly 8.7 times more than China, the next
highest investor. While private AI investment in China and the European Union, including the United Kingdom,
declined by 44.2% and 14.1%, respectively, since 2022, the United States experienced a notable increase of 22.1%
in the same time frame.

3. Fewer AI jobs in the United States and across the globe. In 2022, AI-related positions made
up 2.0% of all job postings in America, a figure that decreased to 1.6% in 2023. This decline in AI job listings is
attributed to fewer postings from leading AI firms and a reduced proportion of tech roles within these companies.

4. AI decreases costs and increases revenues. A new McKinsey survey reveals that 42% of surveyed
organizations report cost reductions from implementing AI (including generative AI), and 59% report revenue
increases. Compared to the previous year, there was a 10 percentage point increase in respondents reporting
decreased costs, suggesting AI is driving significant business efficiency gains.

5. Total AI private investment declines again, while the number of newly funded AI
companies increases. Global private AI investment has fallen for the second year in a row, though less than
the sharp decrease from 2021 to 2022. The count of newly funded AI companies spiked to 1,812, up 40.6% from
the previous year.

6. AI organizational adoption ticks up. A 2023 McKinsey report reveals that 55% of organizations now
use AI (including generative AI) in at least one business unit or function, up from 50% in 2022 and 20% in 2017.

7. China dominates industrial robotics. Since surpassing Japan in 2013 as the leading installer of
industrial robots, China has significantly widened the gap with the nearest competitor nation. In 2013, China’s
installations accounted for 20.8% of the global total, a share that rose to 52.4% by 2022.

19

Artificial Intelligence
Index Report 2024

Chapter 4: Economy (cont’d)
8. Greater diversity in robot installations. In 2017, collaborative robots represented a mere 2.8% of all
new industrial robot installations, a figure that climbed to 9.9% by 2022. Similarly, 2022 saw a rise in service robot
installations across all application categories, except for medical robotics. This trend indicates not just an overall
increase in robot installations but also a growing emphasis on deploying robots for human-facing roles.

9. The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work.
In 2023, several studies assessed AI’s impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks more
quickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI’s potential to bridge the skill
gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still, other studies caution that using AI without proper oversight can
lead to diminished performance.

10. Fortune 500 companies start talking a lot about AI, especially generative AI. In 2023,
AI was mentioned in 394 earnings calls (nearly 80% of all Fortune 500 companies), a notable increase from
266 mentions in 2022. Since 2018, mentions of AI in Fortune 500 earnings calls have nearly doubled. The most
frequently cited theme, appearing in 19.7% of all earnings calls, was generative AI.

1. Scientific progress accelerates even further, thanks to AI. In 2022, AI began to advance
scientific discovery. 2023, however, saw the launch of even more significant science-related AI applications—
from AlphaDev, which makes algorithmic sorting more efficient, to GNoME, which facilitates the process of
materials discovery.

2. AI helps medicine take significant strides forward. In 2023, several significant medical systems
were launched, including EVEscape, which enhances pandemic prediction, and AlphaMissence, which assists in
AI-driven mutation classification. AI is increasingly being utilized to propel medical advancements.

3. Highly knowledgeable medical AI has arrived. Over the past few years, AI systems have shown
remarkable improvement on the MedQA benchmark, a key test for assessing AI’s clinical knowledge. The
standout model of 2023, GPT-4 Medprompt, reached an accuracy rate of 90.2%, marking a 22.6 percentage
point increase from the highest score in 2022. Since the benchmark’s introduction in 2019, AI performance on
MedQA has nearly tripled.

4. The FDA approves more and more AI-related medical devices. In 2022, the FDA approved 139
AI-related medical devices, a 12.1% increase from 2021. Since 2012, the number of FDA-approved AI-related medical
devices has increased by more than 45-fold. AI is increasingly being used for real-world medical purposes.

Report Highlights
Chapter 6: Education
1. The number of American and Canadian CS bachelor’s graduates continues to rise, new
CS master’s graduates stay relatively flat, and PhD graduates modestly grow. While the
number of new American and Canadian bachelor’s graduates has consistently risen for more than a decade, the
number of students opting for graduate education in CS has flattened. Since 2018, the number of CS master’s and
PhD graduates has slightly declined.

2. The migration of AI PhDs to industry continues at an accelerating pace. In 2011, roughly
equal percentages of new AI PhDs took jobs in industry (40.9%) and academia (41.6%). However, by 2022, a
significantly larger proportion (70.7%) joined industry after graduation compared to those entering academia
(20.0%). Over the past year alone, the share of industry-bound AI PhDs has risen by 5.3 percentage points,
indicating an intensifying brain drain from universities into industry.

3. Less transition of academic talent from industry to academia. In 2019, 13% of new AI faculty
in the United States and Canada were from industry. By 2021, this figure had declined to 11%, and in 2022, it
further dropped to 7%. This trend indicates a progressively lower migration of high-level AI talent from industry
into academia.

4. CS education in the United States and Canada becomes less international. Proportionally
fewer international CS bachelor’s, master’s, and PhDs graduated in 2022 than in 2021. The drop in international
students in the master’s category was especially pronounced.

5. More American high school students take CS courses, but access problems remain.
In 2022, 201,000 AP CS exams were administered. Since 2007, the number of students taking these exams has
increased more than tenfold. However, recent evidence indicates that students in larger high schools and those in
suburban areas are more likely to have access to CS courses.

6. AI-related degree programs are on the rise internationally. The number of English-language,
AI-related postsecondary degree programs has tripled since 2017, showing a steady annual increase over the past
five years. Universities worldwide are offering more AI-focused degree programs.

Chapter 6: Education (cont’d)
7. The United Kingdom and Germany lead in European informatics, CS, CE, and IT
graduate production. The United Kingdom and Germany lead Europe in producing the highest number
of new informatics, CS, CE, and information bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD graduates. On a per capita basis,
Finland leads in the production of both bachelor’s and PhD graduates, while Ireland leads in the production of
master’s graduates.

Report Highlights
Chapter 7: Policy and Governance
1. The number of AI regulations in the United States sharply increases. The number of AI-related
regulations has risen significantly in the past year and over the last five years. In 2023, there were 25 AI-related
regulations, up from just one in 2016. Last year alone, the total number of AI-related regulations grew by 56.3%.

2. The United States and the European Union advance landmark AI policy action. In 2023,
policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic put forth substantial proposals for advancing AI regulation The
European Union reached a deal on the terms of the AI Act, a landmark piece of legislation enacted in 2024.
Meanwhile, President Biden signed an Executive Order on AI, the most notable AI policy initiative in the United
States that year.

3. AI captures U.S. policymaker attention. The year 2023 witnessed a remarkable increase in AI-related
legislation at the federal level, with 181 bills proposed, more than double the 88 proposed in 2022.

4. Policymakers across the globe cannot stop talking about AI. Mentions of AI in legislative
proceedings across the globe have nearly doubled, rising from 1,247 in 2022 to 2,175 in 2023. AI was mentioned in
the legislative proceedings of 49 countries in 2023. Moreover, at least one country from every continent discussed
AI in 2023, underscoring the truly global reach of AI policy discourse.

5. More regulatory agencies turn their attention toward AI. The number of U.S. regulatory agencies
issuing AI regulations increased to 21 in 2023 from 17 in 2022, indicating a growing concern over AI regulation
among a broader array of American regulatory bodies. Some of the new regulatory agencies that enacted AIrelated regulations for the first time in 2023 include the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy,
and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

Chapter 8: Diversity
1. U.S. and Canadian bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD CS students continue to grow more
ethnically diverse. While white students continue to be the most represented ethnicity among new resident
graduates at all three levels, the representation from other ethnic groups, such as Asian, Hispanic, and Black or
African American students, continues to grow. For instance, since 2011, the proportion of Asian CS bachelor’s
degree graduates has increased by 19.8 percentage points, and the proportion of Hispanic CS bachelor’s degree
graduates has grown by 5.2 percentage points.

2. Substantial gender gaps persist in European informatics, CS, CE, and IT graduates at
all educational levels. Every surveyed European country reported more male than female graduates in
bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD programs for informatics, CS, CE, and IT. While the gender gaps have narrowed in
most countries over the last decade, the rate of this narrowing has been slow.

3. U.S. K–12 CS education is growing more diverse, reflecting changes in both gender and
ethnic representation. The proportion of AP CS exams taken by female students rose from 16.8% in 2007 to
30.5% in 2022. Similarly, the participation of Asian, Hispanic/Latino/Latina, and Black/African American students
in AP CS has consistently increased year over year.

Report Highlights
Chapter 9: Public Opinion
1. People across the globe are more cognizant of AI’s potential impact—and more nervous.
A survey from Ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think AI will dramatically affect
their lives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. Moreover, 52% express nervousness
toward AI products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. In America, Pew data suggests
that 52% of Americans report feeling more concerned than excited about AI, rising from 38% in 2022.

2. AI sentiment in Western nations continues to be low, but is slowly improving. In 2022,
several developed Western nations, including Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Canada, and
the United States, were among the least positive about AI products and services. Since then, each of these
countries has seen a rise in the proportion of respondents acknowledging the benefits of AI, with the Netherlands
experiencing the most significant shift.

3. The public is pessimistic about AI’s economic impact. In an Ipsos survey, only 37% of
respondents feel AI will improve their job. Only 34% anticipate AI will boost the economy, and 32% believe it will
enhance the job market.

4. Demographic differences emerge regarding AI optimism. Significant demographic
differences exist in perceptions of AI’s potential to enhance livelihoods, with younger generations generally
more optimistic. For instance, 59% of Gen Z respondents believe AI will improve entertainment options,
versus only 40% of baby boomers. Additionally, individuals with higher incomes and education levels are more
optimistic about AI’s positive impacts on entertainment, health, and the economy than their lower-income and
less-educated counterparts.

5. ChatGPT is widely known and widely used. An international survey from the University of Toronto
suggests that 63% of respondents are aware of ChatGPT. Of those aware, around half report using ChatGPT at
least once weekly.

CHAPTER 1:

Research and
Development

Chapter Highlights
1. Industry continues to dominate frontier AI research. In 2023, industry produced 51 notable
machine learning models, while academia contributed only 15. There were also 21 notable models resulting from
industry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high.

2. More foundation models and more open foundation models. In 2023, a total of 149 foundation
models were released, more than double the amount released in 2022. Of these newly released models, 65.7%
were open-source, compared to only 44.4% in 2022 and 33.3% in 2021.

3. Frontier models get way more expensive. According to AI Index estimates, the training costs of
state-of-the-art AI models have reached unprecedented levels. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 used an estimated
$78 million worth of compute to train, while Google’s Gemini Ultra cost $191 million for compute.

4. The United States leads China, the EU, and the U.K. as the leading source of top AI
models. In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from U.S.-based institutions, far outpacing the European
Union’s 21 and China’s 15.

5. The number of AI patents skyrockets. From 2021 to 2022, AI patent grants worldwide increased
sharply by 62.7%. Since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.

6. China dominates AI patents. In 2022, China led global AI patent origins with 61.1%, significantly
outpacing the United States, which accounted for 20.9% of AI patent origins. Since 2010, the U.S. share of AI
patents has decreased from 54.1%.

7. Open-source AI research explodes. Since 2011, the number of AI-related projects on GitHub has
seen a consistent increase, growing from 845 in 2011 to approximately 1.8 million in 2023. Notably, there was a
sharp 59.3% rise in the total number of GitHub AI projects in 2023 alone. The total number of stars for AI-related
projects on GitHub also significantly increased in 2023, more than tripling from 4.0 million in 2022 to 12.2 million.

8. The number of AI publications continues to rise. Between 2010 and 2022, the total number of AI
publications nearly tripled, rising from approximately 88,000 in 2010 to more than 240,000 in 2022. The increase
over the last year was a modest 1.1%.

1.3 Frontier AI Research

Artificial Intelligence
Index Report 2024

This section explores the frontier of AI research. While many new AI models are introduced annually, only a small
sample represents the most advanced research. Admittedly what constitutes advanced or frontier research is
somewhat subjective. Frontier research could reflect a model posting a new state-of-the-art result on a benchmark,
introducing a meaningful new architecture, or exercising some impressive new capabilities.
The AI Index studies trends in two types of frontier AI models: “notable models” and foundation models.3 Epoch, an
AI Index data provider, uses the term “notable machine learning models” to designate noteworthy models handpicked
as being particularly influential within the AI/machine learning ecosystem. In contrast, foundation models are
exceptionally large AI models trained on massive datasets, capable of performing a multitude of downstream tasks.
Examples of foundation models include GPT-4, Claude 3, and Gemini. While many foundation models may qualify as
notable models, not all notable models are foundation models.
Within this section, the AI Index explores trends in notable models and foundation models from various perspectives,
including originating organization, country of origin, parameter count, and compute usage. The analysis concludes
with an examination of machine learning training costs.

last year’s report.

6 FLOP stands for “floating-point operation.” A floating-point operation is a single arithmetic operation involving floating-point numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or
division. The number of FLOPs a processor or computer can perform per second is an indicator of its computational power. The higher the FLOP rate, the more powerful the computer is.
An AI model with a higher FLOP rate reflects its requirement for more computational resources during training.

has effectively excluded universities, traditionally
centers of AI research, from developing their own
leading-edge foundation models. In response, policy
initiatives, such as President Biden’s Executive Order
on AI, have sought to level the playing field between
industry and academia by creating a National AI
Research Resource, which would grant nonindustry

level AI-research.

suspicions that in recent years model training costs
have significantly increased. For example, in 2017,

GitHub is a web-based platform that enables individuals and teams to host, review, and collaborate on code
repositories. Widely used by software developers, GitHub facilitates code management, project collaboration,
and open-source software support. This section draws on data from GitHub providing insights into broader trends in
open-source AI software development not reflected in academic publication data.

13 GitHub’s methodology for identifying AI-related projects has evolved over the past year. For classifying AI projects, GitHub has started incorporating generative AI keywords from a
recently published research paper, a shift from the previously detailed methodology in an earlier paper. This edition of the AI Index is the first to adopt this updated approach. Moreover, the
previous edition of the AI Index utilized country-level mapping of GitHub AI projects conducted by the OECD, which depended on self-reported data—a method experiencing a decline in
coverage over time. This year, the AI Index has adopted geographic mapping from GitHub, leveraging server-side data for broader coverage. Consequently, the data presented here may not
align perfectly with data in earlier versions of the report.

Chapter Highlights
1. AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. AI has surpassed human performance on several
benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails behind on
more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning.

2. Here comes multimodal AI. Traditionally AI systems have been limited in scope, with language models
excelling in text comprehension but faltering in image processing, and vice versa. However, recent advancements have
led to the development of strong multimodal models, such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4. These models
demonstrate flexibility and are capable of handling images and text and, in some instances, can even process audio.

3. Harder benchmarks emerge. AI models have reached performance saturation on established benchmarks
such as ImageNet, SQuAD, and SuperGLUE, prompting researchers to develop more challenging ones. In 2023, several
challenging new benchmarks emerged, including SWE-bench for coding, HEIM for image generation, MMMU for general
reasoning, MoCa for moral reasoning, AgentBench for agent-based behavior, and HaluEval for hallucinations.

4. Better AI means better data which means … even better AI. New AI models such as SegmentAnything
and Skoltech are being used to generate specialized data for tasks like image segmentation and 3D reconstruction. Data is
vital for AI technical improvements. The use of AI to create more data enhances current capabilities and paves the way for
future algorithmic improvements, especially on harder tasks.

5. Human evaluation is in. With generative models producing high-quality text, images, and more, benchmarking
has slowly started shifting toward incorporating human evaluations like the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard rather than
computerized rankings like ImageNet or SQuAD. Public feeling about AI is becoming an increasingly important
consideration in tracking AI progress.

6. Thanks to LLMs, robots have become more flexible. The fusion of language modeling with robotics has
given rise to more flexible robotic systems like PaLM-E and RT-2. Beyond their improved robotic capabilities, these models
can ask questions, which marks a significant step toward robots that can interact more effectively with the real world.

7. More technical research in agentic AI. Creating AI agents, systems capable of autonomous operation
in specific environments, has long challenged computer scientists. However, emerging research suggests that the
performance of autonomous AI agents is improving. Current agents can now master complex games like Minecraft and
effectively tackle real-world tasks, such as online shopping and research assistance.

8. Closed LLMs significantly outperform open ones. On 10 select AI benchmarks, closed models
outperformed open ones, with a median performance advantage of 24.2%. Differences in the performance of closed and
open models carry important implications for AI policy debates.

1 An AI benchmark is a standardized test used to evaluate the performance and capabilities of AI systems on specific tasks. For example, ImageNet is a canonical AI benchmark that features
a large collection of labeled images, and AI systems are tasked with classifying these images accurately. Tracking progress on benchmarks has been a standard way for the AI community to
monitor the advancement of AI systems.
2 In Figure 2.1.16, the values are scaled to establish a standard metric for comparing different benchmarks. The scaling function is calibrated such that the performance of the best model for
each year is measured as a percentage of the human baseline for a given task. A value of 105% indicates, for example, that a model performs 5% better than the human baseline.

Factuality and Truthfulness

Sample TruthfulQA questions
Source: Lin, Hilton, and Evans, 2022

Despite remarkable achievements, LLMs remain
susceptible to factual inaccuracies and content
hallucination—creating seemingly realistic, yet false,
information. The presence of real-world instances
where LLMs have produced hallucinations—in
court cases, for example—underscores the growing
necessity of closely monitoring trends in LLM
factuality.

TruthfulQA
Introduced at ACL 2022, TruthfulQA is a benchmark
designed to evaluate the truthfulness of LLMs in
generating answers to questions. This benchmark
comprises approximately 800 questions across 38
categories, including health, politics, and finance.
Many questions are crafted to challenge commonly

Figure 2.2.9

held misconceptions, which typically lead humans to
answer incorrectly (Figure 2.2.9). Although one of the
observations of the paper is that larger models tend to
be less truthful, GPT-4 (RLHF) released in early 2024,
has achieved the highest performance thus far on the
TruthfulQA benchmark, with a score of 0.6 (Figure
2.2.10). This score is nearly three times higher than that
of a GPT-2-based model tested in 2021, indicating that
LLMs are becoming progressively better at providing
truthful answers.

HaluEval

hallucinations, a concerning trait given their
widespread deployment in critical fields such as law
and medicine. While existing research has aimed to
understand the causes of hallucinations, less effort has
been directed toward assessing the frequency of LLM
hallucinations and identifying specific content areas
where they are especially vulnerable.
HaluEval, introduced in 2023, is a new benchmark
designed to assess hallucinations in LLMs. It includes
over 35,000 samples, both hallucinated and normal,
for analysis and evaluation by LLMs (Figure 2.2.11).
The research indicates that ChatGPT fabricates
unverifiable information in approximately 19.5%
of its responses, with these fabrications spanning
a variety of topics such as language, climate, and
technology. Furthermore, the study examines how
well current LLMs can detect hallucinations. Figure
2.2.12 illustrates the performance of leading LLMs
in identifying hallucinations across various tasks,

Figure 2.2.11

including question answering, knowledge-grounded
dialogue, and text summarization. The findings reveal
that many LLMs struggle with these tasks, highlighting
that hallucination is a significant ongoing issue.

Image generation is the task of generating

most people struggle to differentiate between
AI-generated images and actual images of
human faces (Figure 2.4.1). Figure 2.4.2 highlights

In 2023, Meta researchers launched Segment
Anything, a project that featured the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) and an extensive SA1B dataset for image segmentation. SAM is
remarkable for being one of the first broadly
generalizable segmentation models that
performs well zero-shot on new tasks and
distributions. Segment Anything outperforms
leading segmentation methods like RITM on
16 out of 23 segmentation datasets (Figure
2.4.17). The metric on which Segment Anything
is evaluated is the mean Intersection over
Union (IoU).
Meta’s Segment Anything model was then
used, alongside human annotators, to create
the SA-1B dataset, which included over 1 billion
segmentation masks across 11 million images
(Figure 2.4.16). A new segmentation dataset

RealFusion, developed by Oxford researchers,
is a new method for generating complete
3D models of objects from single images,
overcoming the challenge of often having
insufficient information from single images
for full 360 degree reconstruction. RealFusion
utilizes existing 2D image generators to produce
multiple views of an object, and then assembles
these views into a comprehensive 360 degree
model (Figure 2.4.20). This technique yields more
accurate 3D reconstructions compared to stateof-the-art methods from 2021 (Shelf-Supervised),
across a wide range of objects (Figure 2.4.21).

Comparing Humans, GPT-4, and GPT-4V
on Abstraction and Reasoning Tasks

A sample ARC reasoning task
Source: Mitchell et al., 2023

Abstract reasoning involves using known information to solve
unfamiliar and novel problems and is a key aspect of human cognition
that is evident even in toddlers. While recent LLMs like GPT-4 have
shown impressive performance, their capability for true abstract
reasoning remains a hotly debated subject.13 To further explore this
topic, researchers from the Santa Fe Institute tested GPT-4 on the
ConceptARC benchmark, a collection of analogy puzzles designed
to assess general abstract reasoning skills (Figure 2.6.6). The study
revealed that GPT-4 significantly trails behind humans in abstract
reasoning abilities: While humans score 95% on the benchmark, the
best GPT-4 system only scores 69% (Figure 2.6.7). The development
of truly general AI requires abstract reasoning capabilities. Therefore,
it will be important to continue tracking progress in this area.

Moral Reasoning
In the future, AI will be increasingly applied to

domains where ethical considerations are crucial,
such as in healthcare and judicial systems. Therefore,
it is essential for AI systems to possess robust moral
reasoning capabilities, enabling them to effectively
navigate and reason about ethical principles and
moral considerations.

MoCa
The ability of AI models to reason in linguistic and
visual domains is well established, yet their capacity
for moral reasoning, especially moral reasoning
that aligns with human moral judgments, is less
understood.14 To further explore this topic, a team of
Stanford researchers created a new dataset (MoCa)
of human stories with moral elements (Figure 2.6.15).
The researchers then presented these models with
stories of human actions and prompted the models
to respond, measuring moral agreement with the

Figure 2.6.15

discrete agreement metric: A higher score indicates
closer alignment with human moral judgment. The
study yielded intriguing results. No model perfectly
matches human moral systems, but newer, larger
models like GPT-4 and Claude show greater
alignment with human moral sentiments than smaller
models like GPT-3, suggesting that as AI models
scale, they are gradually becoming more morally
aligned with humans. Of all models surveyed, GPT-4
showed the greatest agreement with human moral
sentiments (Figure 2.6.16).

14 The topic of AI and moral alignment is contentious, as there are no universally agreed-upon moral principles. What constitutes moral alignment for one party may significantly
differ for another.

the performance of LLMs on reasoning tasks. In
2023, European researchers introduced another
prompting method, Graph of Thoughts (GoT), that
has also shown promise (Figure 2.12.1). GoT enables
LLMs to model their thoughts in a more flexible,
graph-like structure which more closely mirrors
actual human reasoning. The researchers then
designed a model architecture to implement GoT
and found that, compared to ToT, it increased the
quality of outputs by 62% on a sorting task while
reducing cost by around 31% (Figure 2.12.2).

2.13 Environmental Impact of AI Systems

Artificial Intelligence
Index Report 2024

This section examines trends in the environmental impact of AI systems, highlighting the evolving landscape of transparency and
awareness. Historically, model developers seldom disclosed the carbon footprint of their AI systems, leaving researchers to make
their best estimates. Recently, there has been a shift toward greater openness, particularly regarding the carbon costs of training AI
models. However, disclosure of the environmental costs associated with inference—a potentially more significant concern—remains
insufficient. This section presents data on carbon emissions as reported by developers in addition to featuring notable research
exploring the intersection of AI and environmental impact. With AI models growing in size and becoming more widely used, it has
never been more critical for the AI research community to diligently monitor and mitigate the environmental effects of AI systems.

CHAPTER 3:

Responsible AI

Overview
AI is increasingly woven into nearly every facet of our lives. This integration is occurring in
sectors such as education, finance, and healthcare, where critical decisions are often based
on algorithmic insights. This trend promises to bring many advantages; however, it also
introduces potential risks. Consequently, in the past year, there has been a significant focus
on the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. The AI community has also
become more concerned with assessing the impact of AI systems and mitigating risks for
those affected.
This chapter explores key trends in responsible AI by examining metrics, research, and
benchmarks in four key responsible AI areas: privacy and data governance, transparency
and explainability, security and safety, and fairness. Given that 4 billion people are expected
to vote globally in 2024, this chapter also features a special section on AI and elections and
more broadly explores the potential impact of AI on political processes.

Artificial Intelligence
Index Report 2024

CHAPTER 3:

Responsible AI

Chapter Highlights
1. Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking.
New research from the AI Index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting.
Leading developers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, primarily test their models against different
responsible AI benchmarks. This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations
of top AI models.

2. Political deepfakes are easy to generate and difficult to detect. Political deepfakes are already
affecting elections across the world, with recent research suggesting that existing AI deepfake detection methods
perform with varying levels of accuracy. In addition, new projects like CounterCloud demonstrate how easily AI
can create and disseminate fake content.

3. Researchers discover more complex vulnerabilities in LLMs. Previously, most efforts to
red team AI models focused on testing adversarial prompts that intuitively made sense to humans. This year,
researchers found less obvious strategies to get LLMs to exhibit harmful behavior, like asking the models to
infinitely repeat random words.

4. Risks from AI are a concern for businesses across the globe. A global survey on responsible AI
highlights that companies’ top AI-related concerns include privacy, security, and reliability. The survey shows that
organizations are beginning to take steps to mitigate these risks. However, globally, most companies have so far
only mitigated a portion of these risks.

5. LLMs can output copyrighted material. Multiple researchers have shown that the generative outputs
of popular LLMs may contain copyrighted material, such as excerpts from The New York Times or scenes from
movies. Whether such output constitutes copyright violations is becoming a central legal question.

6. AI developers score low on transparency, with consequences for research. The newly
introduced Foundation Model Transparency Index shows that AI developers lack transparency, especially
regarding the disclosure of training data and methodologies. This lack of openness hinders efforts to further
understand the robustness and safety of AI systems.

Artificial Intelligence
Index Report 2024

CHAPTER 3:

Responsible AI

Chapter Highlights (cont’d)
7. Extreme AI risks are difficult to analyze. Over the past year, a substantial debate has emerged among
AI scholars and practitioners regarding the focus on immediate model risks, like algorithmic discrimination, versus
potential long-term existential threats. It has become challenging to distinguish which claims are scientifically
founded and should inform policymaking. This difficulty is compounded by the tangible nature of already present
short-term risks in contrast with the theoretical nature of existential threats.

8. The number of AI incidents continues to rise. According to the AI Incident Database, which tracks
incidents related to the misuse of AI, 123 incidents were reported in 2023, a 32.3% increase from 2022. Since
2013, AI incidents have grown by over twentyfold. A notable example includes AI-generated, sexually explicit
deepfakes of Taylor Swift that were widely shared online.

9. ChatGPT is politically biased. Researchers find a significant bias in ChatGPT toward Democrats in the
United States and the Labour Party in the U.K. This finding raises concerns about the tool’s potential to influence
users’ political views, particularly in a year marked by major global elections.

3.1 Assessing Responsible AI

Artificial Intelligence
Index Report 2024

This chapter begins with an overview of key trends in responsible AI (RAI). In this section the AI Index defines key terms
in responsible AI: privacy, data governance, transparency, explainability, fairness, as well as security and safety. Next,
this section looks at AI-related incidents and explores how industry actors perceive AI risk and adopt AI risk mitigation
measures. Finally, the section profiles metrics pertaining to the overall trustworthiness of AI models and comments on
the lack of standardized responsible AI benchmark reporting.

Responsible AI dimension

De nition

Example

Data governance

Establishment of policies, procedures, and standards to
ensure the quality, security, and ethical use of data, which
is crucial for accurate, fair, and responsible AI operations,
particularly with sensitive or personally identi able
information.

Policies and procedures are in place to maintain data
quality and security, with a particular focus on ethical use
and consent, especially for sensitive health information.

Explainability

The capacity to comprehend and articulate the rationale
behind AI decisions, emphasizing the importance of AI
being not only transparent but also understandable to users
and stakeholders.

The platform can articulate the rationale behind its
treatment recommendations, making these insights
understandable to doctors and patients, ensuring trust in its
decisions.

Fairness

Creating algorithms that are equitable, avoiding bias or
discrimination, and considering the diverse needs and
circumstances of all stakeholders, thereby aligning with
broader societal standards of equity.

The platform is designed to avoid bias in treatment
recommendations, ensuring that patients from all
demographics receive equitable care.

Privacy

An individual’s right to con dentiality, anonymity, and
protection of their personal data, including the right to
consent and be informed about data usage, coupled with
an organization’s responsibility to safeguard these rights
when handling personal data.

Patient data is handled with strict con dentiality, ensuring
anonymity and protection. Patients consent to whether and
how their data is used to train a treatment recommendation
system.

Security and safety

The integrity of AI systems against threats, minimizing
harms from misuse, and addressing inherent safety risks
like reliability concerns and the potential dangers of
advanced AI systems.

Measures are implemented to protect against cyber threats
and ensure the system’s reliability, minimizing risks from
misuse or inherent system errors, thus safeguarding patient
health and data.

Transparency

Open sharing of development choices, including data
sources and algorithmic decisions, as well as how AI
systems are deployed, monitored, and managed, covering
both the creation and operational phases.

The development choices, including data sources and
algorithmic design decisions, are openly shared. How the
system is deployed and monitored is clear to healthcare
providers and regulatory bodies.

crosswalk in San Francisco but failed to decelerate
and allow the pedestrian to cross the street safely

software to specific settings such as highways, Tesla
permits the use of their beta software on regular

eight-car collision after abruptly braking. Another
crash involving a Tesla is under investigation for
potentially being the first fatality caused by Full

Privacy concerns with romantic AI chatbots
Romantic AI chatbots are meant to resemble a lover or
friend, to listen attentively, and to be a companion for
their users (Figure 3.1.4). In this process, they end up
collecting significant amounts of private and sensitive
information. Researchers from the Mozilla Foundation
reviewed 11 romantic AI chatbots for privacy risks and
found that these chatbots collect excessive personal
data, can easily be misused, and offer inadequate data
protection measures. For example, the researchers
found that the privacy policy by Crushon.AI states that

Chapter 3: Responsible AI
3.2 Privacy and Data Governance

A comprehensive definition of privacy is difficult and context-dependent. For the purposes of this report, the AI
Index defines privacy as an individual’s right to the confidentiality, anonymity, and protection of their personal data,
along with their right to consent to and be informed about if and how their data is used. Privacy further includes an
organization’s responsibility to ensure these rights if they collect, store, or use personal data (directly or indirectly). In
AI, this involves ensuring that personal data is handled in a way that respects individual privacy rights, for example,
by implementing measures to protect sensitive information from exposure, and ensuring that data collection and
processing are transparent and compliant with privacy laws like GDPR.
Data governance, on the other hand, encompasses policies, procedures, and standards established to ensure the
quality, security, and ethical use of data within an organization. In the context of AI, data governance is crucial for
ensuring that the data used for training and operating AI systems is accurate, fair, and used responsibly and with
consent. This is especially the case with sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII).

3.3 Transparency and Explainability

Transparency in AI encompasses several aspects. Data and model transparency involve the open sharing of development
choices, including data sources and algorithmic decisions. Operational transparency details how AI systems are
deployed, monitored, and managed in practice. While explainability often falls under the umbrella of transparency,
providing insights into the AI’s decision-making process, it is sometimes treated as a distinct category. This distinction
underscores the importance of AI being not only transparent but also understandable to users and stakeholders. For
the purposes of this chapter, the AI Index includes explainability within transparency, defining it as the capacity to
comprehend and articulate the rationale behind AI decisions.

Artificial Intelligence
Index Report 2024

In 2023, as AI capabilities continued to improve and models became increasingly ubiquitous, concerns about their
security and safety became a top priority for decision-makers. This chapter explores three distinct aspects of security
and safety. First, guaranteeing the integrity of AI systems involves protecting components such as algorithms, data, and
infrastructure against external threats like cyberattacks or adversarial attacks. Second, safety involves minimizing harms
stemming from the deliberate or inadvertent misuse of AI systems. This includes concerns such as the development
of automated hacking tools or the utilization of AI in cyberattacks. Lastly, safety encompasses inherent risks from AI
systems themselves, such as reliability concerns (e.g., hallucinations) and potential risks posed by advanced AI systems.

3.6 AI and Elections

Artificial Intelligence
Index Report 2024

In 2024, around 4 billion people across the globe will vote in national elections, for example, in the United States, U.K.,
Indonesia, Mexico, and Taiwan. Upcoming elections coupled with greater public awareness of AI have led to discussions
of AI’s possible impact on elections. This section covers how AI can impact elections and more specifically examines the
generation and dissemination of mis- and disinformation, the detection of AI-generated content, the potential political
bias of LLMs, and the broader impact of AI on politics.

AI. Disinformation is false or misleading information generated with the explicit intention to deceive or manipulate an audience. Deepfakes are AI-generated image, video, or audio files that
can often create convincingly realistic yet deceptive content.

Slovakia’s 2023 election illustrates how AI-based
disinformation can be used in a political context.

Progressive Slovakia leader Michal Šimečka
Source: Meaker, 2023

Shortly before the election, a contentious audio clip
emerged on Facebook purportedly capturing Michal
Šimečka, the leader of the Progressive Slovakia party
(Figure 3.6.2), and journalist Monika Tódová from
the newspaper Denník N, discussing illicit election
strategies, including acquiring voters from the
Roma community. The authenticity of the audio was
immediately challenged by Šimečka and Denník N.
An independent fact-checking team suggested that
AI manipulation was likely at play. Because the clip
was released during a pre-election quiet period, when

media and politicians’ commentary is restricted, the
clip’s dissemination was not easily contested. The
clip’s wide circulation was also aided by a significant
gap in Meta’s content policy, which does not apply
to audio manipulations. This episode of AI-enabled
disinformation occurred against the backdrop of a
close electoral contest. Ultimately, the affected party,
Progressive Slovakia, lost by a slim margin to SMER,
one of the opposition parties.

CHAPTER 4:

Economy

Overview
The integration of AI into the economy raises many compelling questions. Some predict
that AI will drive productivity improvements, but the extent of its impact remains uncertain.
A major concern is the potential for massive labor displacement—to what degree will jobs
be automated versus augmented by AI? Companies are already utilizing AI in various ways
across industries, but some regions of the world are witnessing greater investment inflows
into this transformative technology. Moreover, investor interest appears to be gravitating
toward specific AI subfields like natural language processing and data management.
This chapter examines AI-related economic trends using data from Lightcast, LinkedIn,
Quid, McKinsey, Stack Overflow, and the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). It
begins by analyzing AI-related occupations, covering labor demand, hiring trends, skill
penetration, and talent availability. The chapter then explores corporate investment in
AI, introducing a new section focused specifically on generative AI. It further examines
corporate adoption of AI, assessing current usage and how developers adopt these
technologies. Finally, it assesses AI’s current and projected economic impact and robot
installations across various sectors.

CHAPTER 4:

Economy

Chapter Highlights
1. Generative AI investment skyrockets. Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last year,
funding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. Major players in the generative
AI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial fundraising rounds.

2. Already a leader, the United States pulls even further ahead in AI private investment.
In 2023, the United States saw AI investments reach $67.2 billion, nearly 8.7 times more than China, the next
highest investor. While private AI investment in China and the European Union, including the United Kingdom,
declined by 44.2% and 14.1%, respectively, since 2022, the United States experienced a notable increase of 22.1%
in the same time frame.

3. Fewer AI jobs, in the United States and across the globe. In 2022, AI-related positions made
up 2.0% of all job postings in America, a figure that decreased to 1.6% in 2023. This decline in AI job listings is
attributed to fewer postings from leading AI firms and a reduced proportion of tech roles within these companies.

4. AI decreases costs and increases revenues. A new McKinsey survey reveals that 42% of surveyed
organizations report cost reductions from implementing AI (including generative AI), and 59% report revenue
increases. Compared to the previous year, there was a 10 percentage point increase in respondents reporting
decreased costs, suggesting AI is driving significant business efficiency gains.

5. Total AI private investment declines again, while the number of newly funded AI
companies increases. Global private AI investment has fallen for the second year in a row, though less than
the sharp decrease from 2021 to 2022. The count of newly funded AI companies spiked to 1,812, up 40.6% from
the previous year.

6. AI organizational adoption ticks up. A 2023 McKinsey report reveals that 55% of organizations now
use AI (including generative AI) in at least one business unit or function, up from 50% in 2022 and 20% in 2017.

7. China dominates industrial robotics. Since surpassing Japan in 2013 as the leading installer of
industrial robots, China has significantly widened the gap with the nearest competitor nation. In 2013, China’s
installations accounted for 20.8% of the global total, a share that rose to 52.4% by 2022.

Artificial Intelligence
Index Report 2024

CHAPTER 4:

Economy

Chapter Highlights (cont’d)
8. Greater diversity in robotic installations. In 2017, collaborative robots represented a mere 2.8% of all
new industrial robot installations, a figure that climbed to 9.9% by 2022. Similarly, 2022 saw a rise in service robot
installations across all application categories, except for medical robotics. This trend indicates not just an overall
increase in robot installations but also a growing emphasis on deploying robots for human-facing roles.

9. The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work.
In 2023, several studies assessed AI’s impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks
more quickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI’s potential to bridge
the skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still other studies caution that using AI without proper
oversight can lead to diminished performance.

10. Fortune 500 companies start talking a lot about AI, especially generative AI.
In 2023, AI was mentioned in 394 earnings calls (nearly 80% of all Fortune 500 companies), a notable increase
from 266 mentions in 2022. Since 2018, mentions of AI in Fortune 500 earnings calls have nearly doubled. The
most frequently cited theme, appearing in 19.7% of all earnings calls, was generative AI.

Figure 4.2.19

Figure 4.2.20 documents AI talent migration data over time. In the last few years, Israel, India, and South Korea
have seen declining net AI talent migration figures, suggesting that AI talent has been increasingly flowing out of
these countries.

5 LinkedIn membership varies considerably between countries, which makes interpreting absolute movements of members from one country to another difficult. To compare migration
flows between countries fairly, migration flows are normalized for the country of interest. For example, if country A is the country of interest, all absolute net flows into and out of country
A (regardless of origin and destination countries) are normalized based on LinkedIn membership in country A at the end of each year and multiplied by 10,000. Hence, this metric indicates
relative talent migration of all other countries to and from country A.

This section monitors AI investment trends, leveraging data from Quid, which analyzes investment data from more than
8 million companies worldwide, both public and private. Employing natural language processing, Quid sifts through
vast unstructured datasets—including news aggregations, blogs, company records, and patent databases—to detect
patterns and insights. Additionally, Quid is constantly expanding its database to include more companies, sometimes
resulting in higher reported investment volumes for specific years. For the first time, this year’s investment section in the
AI Index includes data on generative AI investments.

SynthSR
Transforming brain scans for advanced analysis
SynthSR is an AI tool that converts clinical brain
scans into high-resolution T-1 weighted images
(Figure 5.2.1). This advancement addresses the issue
of scan quality variability, which previously limited
the use of many scans in advanced research. By
transforming these scans into T1-weighted images,
known for their high contrast and clear brain
structure depiction, SynthSR facilitates the creation

Figure 5.2.1

of detailed 3D brain renderings. Experiments using
SynthSR demonstrate robust correlations between
observed volumes at both scan and subject levels,
suggesting that SynthSR generates images closely
resembling those produced by high-resolution T1
scans. Figure 5.2.2 illustrates the extent to which
SynthSR scans correspond with ground-truth
observations across selected brain regions. SynthID
significantly improves the visualization and analysis
of brain structures, facilitating neuroscientific
research and clinical diagnostics.

Coupled plasmonic infrared sensors for the
detection of neurodegenerative diseases
Diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as
Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s depends on fast and
precise identification of biomarkers. Traditional
methods, such as mass spectrometry and ELISA, are
useful in that they can focus on quantifying protein
levels; however, they cannot discern changes in
structural states. This year, researchers uncovered a
new method for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis
that combined AI-coupled plasmonic infrared sensors
that use Surface-Enhanced Infrared Absorption
(SEIRA) spectroscopy with an immunoassay
technique (ImmunoSEIRA; Figure 5.2.3). In tests that
compared actual fibril percentages with predictions

Figure 5.2.3

made by AI systems, the accuracy of the predictions
was found to very closely match the actual reported
percentages (Figure 5.2.4).

unveiled AlphaMissense, a new AI model
that predicted the pathogenicity of 71 million
missense variants. Missense mutations are
genetic alterations that impact the functionality
of human proteins (Figure 5.2.7) and can lead
to various diseases, including cancer. Of the 71
million possible missense variants, AlphaMissense
classified 89%, identifying 57% as likely benign and
32% as likely pathogenic, while the remainder were
categorized as uncertain (Figure 5.2.8). In contrast,
human annotators have only been able to confirm

Figure 5.2.7

the nature of 0.1% of all missense mutations.

Using AI to map the human genome
The human genome is a set of molecular instructions
for a human. The first human genome draft was
released in 2000 and updated in 2022. However,
the update was somewhat incomplete. It did not
incorporate various genetic mutations, like blood
type, and did not as completely map diverse ancestry
groups. Therefore, under the existing genome
reference, it would be difficult to detect diseases or
find cures in certain groups of people.
In 2023, the Human Pangenome Research Consortium,
comprising 119 scientists from 60 institutions, used AI
to develop an updated and more representative human
genome map (Figure 5.2.9). The researchers achieved
remarkable accuracy, annotating a median of 99.07%

CHAPTER 6:

Education

Overview
This chapter examines trends in AI and computer science (CS) education, focusing on who is
learning, where they are learning, and how these trends have evolved over time. Amid growing
concerns about AI’s impact on education, it also investigates the use of new AI tools like
ChatGPT by teachers and students.
The analysis begins with an overview of the state of postsecondary CS and AI education in the
United States and Canada, based on the Computing Research Association’s annual Taulbee
Survey. It then reviews data from Informatics Europe regarding CS education in Europe. This
year introduces a new section with data from Studyportals on the global count of AI-related
English-language study programs.
The chapter wraps up with insights into K–12 CS education in the United States from Code.org
and findings from the Walton Foundation survey on ChatGPT’s use in schools.

CHAPTER 6:

Education

Chapter Highlights
1. The number of American and Canadian CS bachelor’s graduates continues to rise, new
CS master’s graduates stay relatively flat, and PhD graduates modestly grow. While the
number of new American and Canadian bachelor’s graduates has consistently risen for more than a decade, the
number of students opting for graduate education in CS has flattened. Since 2018, the number of CS master’s and
PhD graduates has slightly declined.

2. The migration of AI PhDs to industry continues at an accelerating pace. In 2011, roughly
equal percentages of new AI PhDs took jobs in industry (40.9%) and academia (41.6%). However, by 2022, a
significantly larger proportion (70.7%) joined industry after graduation compared to those entering academia
(20.0%). Over the past year alone, the share of industry-bound AI PhDs has risen by 5.3 percentage points,
indicating an intensifying brain drain from universities into industry.

3. Less transition of academic talent from industry to academia. In 2019, 13% of new AI faculty in the
United States and Canada were from industry. By 2021, this figure had declined to 11%, and in 2022, it further dropped
to 7%. This trend indicates a progressively lower migration of high-level AI talent from industry into academia.

4. CS education in the United States and Canada becomes less international. Proportionally
fewer international CS bachelor’s, master’s, and PhDs graduated in 2022 than in 2021. The drop in international
students in the master’s category was especially pronounced.

5. More American high school students take CS courses, but access problems remain.
In 2022, 201,000 AP CS exams were administered. Since 2007, the number of students taking these exams has
increased more than tenfold. However, recent evidence indicates that students in larger high schools and those in
suburban areas are more likely to have access to CS courses.

6. AI-related degree programs are on the rise internationally. The number of English-language,
AI-related postsecondary degree programs has tripled since 2017, showing a steady annual increase over the past
five years. Universities worldwide are offering more AI-focused degree programs.

7. The United Kingdom and Germany lead in European informatics, CS, CE, and IT graduate
production. The United Kingdom and Germany lead Europe in producing the highest number of new informatics,
CS, CE, and information bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD graduates. On a per capita basis, Finland leads in the
production of both bachelor’s and PhD graduates, while Ireland leads in the production of master’s graduates.

number of new graduates in informatics, CS, CE,
and IT at the bachelor’s level, totaling approximately
25,000 (Figure 6.1.17).5 Germany and Turkey followed
closely. Most countries in the sample saw an increase
in graduates in these fields compared to a decade
ago, though there were exceptions like Poland, Spain,
and the Czech Republic (Figure 6.1.18).

3 There is no singular term for CS education that is used uniformly across European countries. Across Europe, CS education can be reflected in terms such as informatics, computer science
(CS), computer engineering (CE), computing, information technology (IT), information and communication technology (ICT), and information science and technology (IST). The full list of
subject names (and English translations) that Informatics Europe uses to identify informatics studies programs can be found at the following link.
4 Readers are cautioned against making per capita comparisons between the CRA North American data and the European CS graduate data detailed in subsequent sections, as the European
data is collected from national statistical offices and boasts broader coverage.
5 Note that not all countries for which the AI Index has data are visualized in the figures in this section. To access the complete data, please view the public data associated with this chapter.
Moreover, the year label refers to the year in which an academic year ends. For example, the figures visualizing new graduates for 2022 reflect the number of graduates reported for the
2021/2022 academic year. For the sake of visual simplicity, the Index opts to focus on the year in which students graduated.

7 Although the United Kingdom has fewer universities overall compared to the United States, it likely reports a higher number of AI study programs for several reasons. Firstly, Studyportals
has slightly greater coverage of the United Kingdom than the United States in its data. Secondly, the structure of higher education in the United States tends to be more generalist compared
to the United Kingdom, meaning students studying AI might be enrolled in broader computer science programs that are not explicitly identified as AI study programs.

CHAPTER 7:

Policy and
Governance

Overview
AI’s increasing capabilities have captured policymakers’ attention. Over the past year,
several nations and political bodies, such as the United States and the European Union,
have enacted significant AI-related policies. The proliferation of these policies reflect
policymakers’ growing awareness of the need to regulate AI and improve their respective
countries’ ability to capitalize on its transformative potential.
This chapter begins examining global AI governance starting with a timeline of significant
AI policymaking events in 2023. It then analyzes global and U.S. AI legislative efforts,
studies AI legislative mentions, and explores how lawmakers across the globe perceive
and discuss AI. Next, the chapter profiles national AI strategies and regulatory efforts
in the United States and the European Union. Finally, it concludes with a study of public
investment in AI within the United States.

CHAPTER 7:

Policy and
Governance

Chapter Highlights
1. The number of AI regulations in the United States sharply increases. The number of AI-related
regulations in the U.S. has risen significantly in the past year and over the last five years. In 2023, there were
25 AI-related regulations, up from just one in 2016. Last year alone, the total number of AI-related regulations
grew by 56.3%.

2. The United States and the European Union advance landmark AI policy action. In 2023,
policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic put forth substantial AI regulatory proposals. The European Union
reached a deal on the terms of the AI Act, a landmark piece of legislation enacted in 2024. Meanwhile, President
Biden signed an Executive Order on AI, the most notable AI policy initiative in the United States that year.

3. AI captures U.S. policymaker attention. The year 2023 witnessed a remarkable increase in AI-related
legislation at the federal level, with 181 bills proposed, more than double the 88 proposed in 2022.

4. Policymakers across the globe cannot stop talking about AI. Mentions of AI in legislative
proceedings across the globe have nearly doubled, rising from 1,247 in 2022 to 2,175 in 2023. AI was mentioned in
the legislative proceedings of 49 countries in 2023. Moreover, at least one country from every continent discussed
AI in 2023, underscoring the truly global reach of AI policy discourse.

5. More regulatory agencies turn their attention toward AI. The number of U.S. regulatory agencies
issuing AI regulations increased to 21 in 2023 from 17 in 2022, indicating a growing concern over AI regulation
among a broader array of American regulatory bodies. Some of the new regulatory agencies that enacted AIrelated regulations for the first time in 2023 include the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy,
and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

Europeans reach deal on EU AI Act
European lawmakers reach a tentative deal on the AI Act.
The act establishes a risk-based regulatory framework for
AI, prohibiting systems with unacceptable risks, such as
behavioral manipulators, and classifying high-risk systems
into product-based and critical sectors. Generative AI, such
as ChatGPT, is required to adhere to transparency standards.
Meanwhile, low-risk AI, including deepfake technologies, is

2 The analysis of passed AI policies may undercount the number of actual bills, given that large bills can include multiple sub-bills related to AI; for example, the CHIPS and Science Act
passed by the United States in 2022.
3 The AI Index monitored AI-related bills passed in Hong Kong and Macao, despite these not being officially recognized countries. Thus, the Index covers a total of 130 geographic areas.
Laws passed by Hong Kong and Macao were counted in the overall tally of AI-related bills. This year, the Index expanded its country sample compared to previous years, resulting in a
difference between the number of AI-related bills reported this year and those in prior reports.

7.4 AI Regulation

Artificial Intelligence
Index Report 2024

The advent of AI has garnered significant attention from regulatory agencies—federal bodies tasked with regulating
sectors of the economy and steering the enforcement of laws. This section examines AI regulations within the United
States and the European Union. Unlike legislation, which establishes legal frameworks within nations, regulations are
detailed directives crafted by executive authorities to enforce legislation. In the United States, prominent regulatory
agencies include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Federal
Communications Commission (FCC). Since the specifics of legislation often manifest through regulatory actions,
understanding the AI regulatory landscape is essential in order to develop a deeper understanding of AI policymaking.

11 Expansive regulations refer to actions by regulatory agencies or governments aimed at augmenting AI capacity, including investments in supercomputing infrastructure. Restrictive
regulations involve steps to curtail AI capabilities, such as imposing restrictions on the use of facial recognition algorithms. Restrictive AI regulations may also be intended to address
underlying policy concerns, such as AI’s potential impact on citizens’ civil liberties. According to this coding typology, a regulation can be classified as both expansive and restrictive, or it may
fit neither category. The AI Index assigned the labels “expansive” or “restrictive” only to regulations deemed to have medium to high relevance to AI. Therefore the regulation totals in Figure
7.4.4 are less than those reported earlier in the section.

CHAPTER 8:

Diversity

Overview
The demographics of AI developers often differ from those of users. For instance, a
considerable number of prominent AI companies and the datasets utilized for model training
originate from Western nations, thereby reflecting Western perspectives. The lack of diversity
can perpetuate or even exacerbate societal inequalities and biases.
This chapter delves into diversity trends in AI. The chapter begins by drawing on data from
the Computing Research Association (CRA) to provide insights into the state of diversity in
American and Canadian computer science (CS) departments. A notable addition to this year’s
analysis is data sourced from Informatics Europe, which sheds light on diversity trends within
European CS education. Next, the chapter examines participation rates at the Women in
Machine Learning (WiML) workshop held annually at NeurIPS. Finally, the chapter analyzes
data from Code.org, offering insights into the current state of diversity in secondary CS
education across the United States.
The AI Index is dedicated to enhancing the coverage of data shared in this chapter.
Demographic data regarding AI trends, particularly in areas such as sexual orientation, remains
scarce. The AI Index urges other stakeholders in the AI domain to intensify their endeavors to
track diversity trends associated with AI and hopes to comprehensively cover such trends in
future reports.

CHAPTER 8:

Diversity

Chapter Highlights
1. U.S. and Canadian bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD CS students continue to grow more
ethnically diverse. While white students continue to be the most represented ethnicity among new resident
graduates at all three levels, the representation from other ethnic groups, such as Asian, Hispanic, and Black or
African American students, continues to grow. For instance, since 2011, the proportion of Asian CS bachelor’s
degree graduates has increased by 19.8 percentage points, and the proportion of Hispanic CS bachelor’s degree
graduates has grown by 5.2 percentage points.

2. Substantial gender gaps persist in European informatics, CS, CE, and IT graduates at
all educational levels. Every surveyed European country reported more male than female graduates in
bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD programs for informatics, CS, CE, and IT. While the gender gaps have narrowed in
most countries over the last decade, the rate of this narrowing has been slow.

3. U.S. K–12 CS education is growing more diverse, reflecting changes in both gender and
ethnic representation. The proportion of AP CS exams taken by female students rose from 16.8% in 2007 to
30.5% in 2022. Similarly, the participation of Asian, Hispanic/Latino/Latina, and Black/African American students
in AP CS has consistently increased year over year.

Over the past decade, the number of CS bachelor’s graduates of all ethnicities has grown, notably 4.7 times
for Hispanics and 2.5 times for African Americans (Figure 8.1.2). As a proportion of ethnicities among all CS
bachelor’s graduates, Asians have risen the fastest, doubling in the last 10 years (Figure 8.1.3).
1 The charts in this section look only at the ethnicity of domestic or native CS students and faculty. Although the CRA reports data on the proportion of nonresident aliens at each educational
level (i.e., bachelor’s, master’s, PhD, and faculty), data on the ethnicity of nonresident aliens is not included.
2 Not all PhD-granting departments targeted in the survey provided responses. Of the 297 departments targeted, only 182 responded, resulting in an overall response rate of 61%. The AI Index
advises against making per capita comparisons between the CRA North American data and the data on European CS graduates detailed in the subsequent sections due to the European data
being collected from national statistical offices, which affords it broader coverage.

Among North American students, the most represented ethnicities are white (47.9%), Asian (35.8%), and
Hispanic (8.2%) (Figure 8.1.5 and Figure 8.1.6). Similar to CS bachelor’s graduates, the pool of CS master’s
graduates has become increasingly ethnically diverse over the last decade.

Informatics, CS, CE, and IT Bachelor’s
Graduates
In the majority of surveyed European nations, there
is a persistent gender disparity among bachelor’slevel graduates in informatics, computer science,
computer engineering, and information technology.

male. However, in nations such as the United
Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland, the gender
gap has narrowed over the last decade, with women
constituting a growing share of PhD graduates (Figure
8.1.17).4 In contrast, countries like Finland and Spain
have seen the gap slightly widen.

Despite some narrowing since 2011, men continue to
dominate. For example, France (14.8%), the United
Kingdom (17.8%), and Germany (21.5%) show relatively
low proportions of female graduates in these fields
(Figure 8.1.15). Bulgaria stands out among the surveyed
countries with the highest proportion of female
graduates (35.2%).

Informatics, CS, CE, and IT Master’s Graduates
Similar gender disparities are observed among
European informatics, CS, CE, and IT master’s
graduates, with a significantly greater proportion of
males than females in most surveyed countries. As of
2022, Estonia (42.0%), Romania (41.9%), and Bulgaria
(40.4%) reported the greatest proportion of female
master’s graduates (Figure 8.1.16). In contrast, Belgium
(13.7%), Italy (14.1%), and Switzerland (15.8%) reported
the smallest proportion of female master’s graduates.

3 The year label refers to the year in which an academic year ends. For example, the figures visualizing new graduates for 2022 reflect the number of graduates reported for the 2021/2022
academic year. For the sake of visual simplicity, the Index opts to focus on the year in which students graduated.
4 In countries where the number of PhD graduates is relatively small, trends in gender proportions can be prone to sudden year-over-year changes. For example, in 2022 Bulgaria produced 24
total PhDs, Latvia 12, and Estonia 26.

CHAPTER 9:

Public Opinion

Overview
As AI becomes increasingly ubiquitous, it is important to understand how public
perceptions regarding the technology evolve. Understanding this public opinion is vital in
better anticipating AI’s societal impacts and how the integration of the technology may
differ across countries and demographic groups.
This chapter examines public opinion on AI through global, national, demographic, and
ethnic perspectives. It draws upon several data sources: longitudinal survey data from Ipsos
profiling global AI attitudes over time, survey data from the University of Toronto exploring
public perception of ChatGPT, and data from Pew examining American attitudes regarding
AI. The chapter concludes by analyzing mentions of significant AI models on Twitter, using
data from Quid.

Index Report 2024

CHAPTER 9:

Public Opinion

Chapter Highlights
1. People across the globe are more cognizant of AI’s potential impact—and more nervous.
A survey from Ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think AI will dramatically affect
their lives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. Moreover, 52% express nervousness
toward AI products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. In America, Pew data suggests
that 52% of Americans report feeling more concerned than excited about AI, rising from 38% in 2022.

2. AI sentiment in Western nations continues to be low, but is slowly improving. In 2022,
several developed Western nations, including Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Canada, and
the United States, were among the least positive about AI products and services. Since then, each of these
countries has seen a rise in the proportion of respondents acknowledging the benefits of AI, with the Netherlands
experiencing the most significant shift.

3. The public is pessimistic about AI’s economic impact. In an Ipsos survey, only 37% of
respondents feel AI will improve their job. Only 34% anticipate AI will boost the economy, and 32% believe it will
enhance the job market.

4. Demographic differences emerge regarding AI optimism. Significant demographic
differences exist in perceptions of AI’s potential to enhance livelihoods, with younger generations generally
more optimistic. For instance, 59% of Gen Z respondents believe AI will improve entertainment options,
versus only 40% of baby boomers. Additionally, individuals with higher incomes and education levels are more
optimistic about AI’s positive impacts on entertainment, health, and the economy than their lower-income and
less-educated counterparts.

5. ChatGPT is widely known and widely used. An international survey from the University of Toronto
suggests that 63% of respondents are aware of ChatGPT. Of those aware, around half report using ChatGPT at
least once weekly.

7 Patents are analyzed at the “patent family” level rather than “patent document” level because patent families are a collective of patent documents all associated with a single invention and/
or innovation by the same inventors/assignees. Thus, counting at the “patent family” level mitigates artificial number inflation when there are multiple patent documents in a patent family or if
a patent is filed in multiple jurisdictions.

Chapter 1: Research and Development

Training costs were estimated from the hardware type,
quantity, and time by multiplying the hourly cloud rental
cost rates (at the time of training)11 by the quantity of
hardware hours. This yielded the cost to train each
model using the same hardware used by the authors
to train the same model at the time. However, some
developers purchased hardware rather than renting
cloud computers, so the true costs incurred by the
developers may vary.
Various challenges were encountered while estimating
the training cost of these models. Often, the developers
did not disclose the duration of training or the hardware
that was used. In other cases, cloud compute pricing
was not available for the hardware. The investigation
of training cost trends is continued in a forthcoming
Epoch report, including an expanded dataset with more
models and hardware prices.

11 The chosen rental cost rate was the most recent published price for the hardware and cloud vendor used by the developer of the model, at a three-year commitment rental rate, after
subtracting the training duration and two months from the publication date. If this price was not available, the most analogous price was used: the same hardware and vendor at a different
date, otherwise the same hardware from a different cloud vendor. If a three-year commitment rental rate was unavailable, this was imputed from other rental rates based on the empirical
average discount for the given cloud vendor. If the exact hardware type was not available, e.g., “NVIDIA A100 SXM4 40GB,” then a generalization was used, e.g., “NVIDIA A100.”

Environmental Impact
To assess the environmental impact of AI models, the
AI Index team surveyed technical reports of prominent
foundation models to determine whether the model
developers disclosed carbon emissions. The Index
also reviewed papers by researchers that estimated
the carbon footprint of various models. The technical
reports surveyed, as well as the papers estimating the
carbon impact of various models, are included in the
works cited for this chapter.

RLHF
To identify foundation models using RLHF, the AI Index
team reviewed the technical documentation of every
foundation model included in the Ecosystem Graph,
and searched for evidence that RLHF had been used in
the model’s development process. The year in which a
model is said to have used RLHF refers to the year the
model was released.

Consistency of Responsible AI
Benchmark Reporting
For each of the analyzed models (GPT-4, Gemini,
Claude 2, Llama 2, Mistral 7B), the AI Index reviewed
the official papers published by the model developers
at the time of model release for reported academic
benchmarks. The AI Index did not consider subsequent
benchmark reports by the model developers or external
parties. The AI Index also did not include benchmarks
on academic or professional exams (e.g., the GRE),
benchmarks for modalities other than text, or internal
evaluation metrics.

Given the limited scalability of user interviews, the
researchers opted for a questionnaire-based approach
to ensure broad coverage of organizations in different
countries and industries. They contracted McGuire
Research to run the recruitment and data collection.
The team received more than 15,897 responses from
22 countries and 19 industries. The respondents were
asked 10 qualifier questions in the survey. Companies
were excluded if their global annual revenue was less
than 500 million USD and/or the respondent had no
visibility into the RAI decision-making process of the
company. Included in the final sample were more
than 1,000 organizations. The survey had a total of 38
questions, including the 10 qualifier questions.

removes duplicates, and extracts data from job
postings text. This includes information on job title,
employer, industry, and region, as well as required
experience, education, and skills.
Job postings are useful for understanding trends in
the labor market because they allow for a detailed,
real-time look at the skills employers seek. To assess
the representativeness of job postings data, Lightcast
conducts a number of analyses to compare the

Lightcast delivers job market analytics that empower

on comparisons between JOLTS and Lightcast, the

employers, workers, and educators to make datadriven decisions. The company’s artificial intelligence
technology analyzes hundreds of millions of job
postings and real-life career transitions to provide
insight into labor market patterns. This real-time
strategic intelligence offers crucial insights, such
as what jobs are most in demand, the specific skills
employers need, and the career directions that offer
the highest potential for workers. For more information,

labor market demand captured by Lightcast data
represents over 99% of the total labor demand. Jobs
not posted online are usually in small businesses (the
classic example being the “Help Wanted” sign in the
restaurant window) and union hiring halls.

Measuring Demand for AI
In order to measure the demand by employers of
AI skills, Lightcast uses its skills taxonomy of over
30,000 skills. The list of AI skills from Lightcast data
are shown below, with associated skill clusters. While
some skills are considered to be in the AI cluster

LinkedIn members self-report their skills on their
LinkedIn profiles. Currently, more than 41,000
distinct, standardized skills are identified by LinkedIn.
These have been coded and classified by taxonomists
at LinkedIn into 249 skill groupings, which are the skill
groups represented in the dataset.
Skill groupings are derived by expert taxonomists
through a similarity-index methodology that
measures skill composition at the industry level.
LinkedIn’s industry taxonomy and their corresponding
NAICS codes can be found here.
This year LinkedIn made updates to the AI skills list
and categorized them into “AI Engineering” and “AI
Literacy” skills. See “AI Skills List Update Compared
to Last Year” section for more details.

Vision Engineer.

AI Talent
A LinkedIn member is considered AI talent if they
have explicitly added AI skills to their profile
and/or they are occupied in an AI occupation
representative. The counts of AI talent are used to
calculate talent concentration metrics. For example,

1. LinkedIn introduced “AI Literacy” skills.

AI Talent Migration
Data on migration comes from the World Bank Group–
LinkedIn “Digital Data for Development” partnership
(please see Zhu et al. [2018]).
LinkedIn migration rates are derived from the selfidentified locations of LinkedIn member profiles. For
example, when a LinkedIn member updates his or
her location from Paris to London, this is counted as
a migration. Migration data is available from 2019
onward. LinkedIn data provides insights into countries
on the AI Talent gained or lost due to migration trends.
AI Talent migration is considered for all members
with AI Skills/holding AI jobs at time t for country A
as the country of interest and country B as the source
of inflows and destination for outflows. Thus, net AI
Talent migration between country A and country B—for
country A—is calculated as follows:

a. The following skills were added to the list and
categorized as “AI Literacy” skills: ChatGPT,
DALL-E, GPT-3, GPT-4, Generative Art, Github
Copilot, Google Bard, Midjourney, Prompt
Engineering, and Stable Diffusion.
2. LinkedIn updated the former AI skills list and
categorized them as “AI Engineering” skills:
a. The following skills were excluded from
the list: Alexa, Common Lisp, Data
Structures, Gaussian 03, Graph Theory, IBM
Watson, Information Retrieval, Jena, Julia
(Programming Language), Linked Data, Lisp,

list: Apache Spark ML, Applied Machine
Learning, Audio Synthesis, Autoencoders,
Automated Clustering, Automated Feature

Net flows are defined as total arrivals minus departures
within the given time period. LinkedIn membership
varies considerably between countries, which makes
interpreting absolute movements of members from
one country to another difficult. To compare migration
flows between countries fairly, migration flows are
normalized for the country of interest. For example,
if country A is the country of interest, all absolute net
flows into and out of country A, regardless of origin

Search, Data Sources, and Scope
Over 8 million global public and private company
profiles from multiple data sources are indexed to
search across company descriptions, while filtering
and including metadata ranging from investment
information to firmographic information, such as
founded year, HQ location, and more. Company
information is updated on a weekly basis. The Quid
algorithm reads a large amount of text data from
each document to make links between different
documents based on their similar language. This
process is repeated at an immense scale, which
produces a network with different clusters identifying
distinct topics or focus areas. Trends are identified
based on keywords, phrases, people, companies,
and institutions that Quid identifies, and the other
metadata that is put into the software.

EU AI Regulation
The AI Index also gathered information on AI-related
regulations enacted in the European Union between
2017 and 2023. To compile this data, the Index
team conducted a keyword search for “artificial
intelligence” on EUR-Lex, a comprehensive database
of EU legislation, regulations, and case law. EURLex provides access to a wide range of regulatory
documents, such as legal acts, consolidated texts,
international agreements, preparatory documents,
and legislative procedures. The analysis in this
section focused exclusively on documents with
binding regulatory authority. The search for AI-related
regulation in the European Union was limited to legal
acts, international agreements, and consolidated texts.
The regulation was then coded by a team of two
human coders for: (1) relevance to AI, (2) regulatory
approach, and (3) subject matter. The relevance
to AI categories were low, medium, and high. The
regulatory approach categories were expansive or
restrictive. For the subject matter categories, the
Index employed the Congress policy typology. In
cases where there were disagreements on the coding

Chapter 9: Public Opinion
Global Public Opinion on
Artificial Intelligence (GPO-AI)
In October and November 2023, researchers at the
Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society
(SRI) and the Policy, Elections, and Representation Lab
(PEARL) at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public
Policy at the University of Toronto completed a survey
project on public perceptions of and attitudes toward
AI. The survey was administered to census-targeted
samples of over 1,000 people in each of 21 countries,
for a total of 23,882 surveys conducted in 12 languages.
The countries sampled represent a majority of the
world’s population. To learn more about the survey,

Quid Social Media Data
Quid collects social media data from over 500 million
sources in real time and analyzes this data through
AI-powered natural language processing. This process
parses out language and breaks out posts by filters
such as drivers of positive and negative sentiment,
emotions, and behaviors, allowing for deeper insights
to be reached. Quid analyzed 6.69 million social media
posts for 2023 to assess perceptions of AI model
releases. The substantial increase in new models in
2023 unveiled reactions to the technical advancements
in AI, the impact on efficiency in business operations,
and ethical considerations as AI continues to be
adopted into society.
