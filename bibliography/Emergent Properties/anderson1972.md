## Summary

Anderson argues that the “constructionist” hypothesis—that the behaviour of large and complex systems can be understood by simple extrapolation from the properties of a few particles—breaks down when confronted with scale and complexity. At each level of complexity entirely new properties appear; understanding them requires research as fundamental as any other. The sciences can be arrayed in a hierarchy (e.g. elementary particle physics → solid-state/many-body physics → chemistry → molecular biology → … → psychology → social sciences) where the “elementary entities” of one level obey the laws of the level below, but this does not imply that “science X is just applied Y.” Broken symmetry and emergence are central: new laws and concepts arise at each level. The essay is a classic defence of fundamental research in “extensive” (applied) sciences and a critique of reductionism that ignores emergence.

## Authors

**P. W. Anderson** — Princeton University; Nobel Prize in Physics (1977) for work on electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems. Pioneering work in condensed matter physics, localisation, and the philosophy of science. “More is different” is widely cited in complexity, emergence, and the limits of reductionism.

## Relevance to our class

- **Emergence and scale**: relevant to discussions of why “more data” or “bigger models” can yield qualitatively new behaviour (e.g. scaling laws, phase transitions in capability).
- **Reductionism vs hierarchy**: AI and LLMs as a new level with their own laws and concepts.
- **Philosophy of science**: what counts as “fundamental” research.

## Key concepts

- **More is different**, broken symmetry, emergence, reductionism, constructionist hypothesis, hierarchy of science, extensive vs intensive research.
