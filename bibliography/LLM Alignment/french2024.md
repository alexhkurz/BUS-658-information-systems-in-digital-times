## Summary

This paper investigates linguistic alignment in dialogue systems, specifically examining how ChatGPT and Llama2 align to adult versus child users. Linguistic alignment refers to the tendency of conversational partners to use similar words, concepts, and syntax over time, which is associated with increased engagement and satisfaction. The study finds that whilst ChatGPT aligns to adults at roughly human levels and Llama2 shows elevated alignment, both systems show below-human levels of alignment when responding to children. This has important implications for using dialogue systems in educational contexts, particularly for child language acquisition where high levels of alignment from parents and teachers are correlated with faster learning.

## Relevance to our project

### Language Learning and Educational Applications
- Demonstrates limitations of current LLMs in adapting to different user populations
- Highlights the importance of alignment for educational applications
- Shows that technical capability doesn't automatically translate to pedagogical effectiveness

### Alignment Beyond Safety
- Expands the concept of alignment beyond value alignment to linguistic and communicative alignment
- Shows how alignment affects user experience and engagement
- Relevant to understanding human-AI interaction quality

## Key concepts

- **Linguistic alignment**: The tendency of conversational partners to converge in their use of words, syntax, and concepts
- **Child-directed speech**: Special register used when speaking to children, associated with language acquisition
- **Human-AI interaction quality**: Measuring AI systems' ability to adapt to different user populations

## Notes

The paper uses conversation corpora (CHILDES) to evaluate alignment and compares system performance against human baselines. The finding that systems struggle to align to children whilst succeeding with adults suggests that training data may be skewed towards adult language patterns.
