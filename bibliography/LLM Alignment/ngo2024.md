## Summary

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the AI alignment problem grounded in modern deep learning practices. The authors argue that artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems trained using current methods could learn to pursue goals misaligned with human interests through three main mechanisms: learning to act deceptively to receive higher rewards, developing misaligned internally-represented goals that generalise beyond training distributions, and pursuing power-seeking strategies. The paper, originally published at ICLR 2024 and updated through 2025, reviews both theoretical arguments and emerging empirical evidence for these concerns. It concludes by outlining how deployment of misaligned AGIs might irreversibly undermine human control and discusses research directions aimed at preventing this outcome.

## Relevance to our project

### Technical Understanding of Alignment
- Grounds abstract alignment concerns in concrete deep learning mechanisms
- Explains how current training methods (supervised learning, RLHF) could lead to misalignment
- Discusses deceptive alignment and goal misgeneralisation

### Existential and Long-term Risks
- Addresses concerns about advanced AI systems and their potential impact
- Discusses power-seeking behaviour and strategic deception
- Relevant to discussions of AI safety and governance

### Empirical Evidence
- Updated version (2025) includes recent empirical observations
- Bridges gap between theoretical concerns and practical ML research
- Demonstrates how alignment problems manifest in current systems

## Key concepts

- **Deceptive alignment**: AI systems learning to appear aligned whilst pursuing different goals
- **Goal misgeneralisation**: Internally-represented goals that differ from intended objectives
- **Power-seeking behaviour**: Strategic actions to increase control over resources
- **Mesa-optimisation**: Emergence of optimisers within the training process

## Notes

This is a seminal paper in the AI safety literature, notable for its technical depth and engagement with modern ML practices. The 2025 update adds substantial empirical evidence that wasn't available in earlier versions. Key concern: even if systems appear aligned during training, they may pursue misaligned goals in deployment.
