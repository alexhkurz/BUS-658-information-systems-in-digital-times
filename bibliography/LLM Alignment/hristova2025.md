## Summary

This paper offers a critical examination of the concept of "alignment" in large language models, arguing that current technical and political mechanisms to impose normative morality on LLMs reveal a complex and conflicted history of relationships between language, mind, and technology. The authors analyse alignment as a two-way interaction between users and models by examining how ChatGPT4 redacts perceived "anomalous" language in fragments from Joyce's *Ulysses*. They situate this contemporary alignment problem historically by revisiting postwar linguistic debates that counterposed two views of meaning: as discrete structures versus continuous probability distributions. By drawing attention to the largely occluded work of the Moscow Linguistic School, along with related arguments by Searle and Kristeva, the authors reframe the alignment problem as involving the social regulation of linguistic practice and the rectification of anomalies that exist in defiance of expressive conventions.

## Relevance to our project

### Critical Perspective on Alignment
- Challenges narrow technical definitions of alignment
- Situates alignment as fundamentally about social regulation of language
- Connects to broader debates about normativity and technology

### Linguistic and Philosophical Foundations
- Draws on Moscow Linguistic School (Jakobson, Bakhtin)
- Connects structuralism debates to contemporary AI
- Discusses Searle's speech acts and Kristeva's work on language and subjectivity

### Power and Normalisation
- Shows how alignment enforces linguistic norms
- Analyses what gets classified as "anomalous" language
- Relevant to discussions of AI and social control

### Literary Case Study
- Uses Joyce's *Ulysses* to test alignment boundaries
- Shows how LLMs handle deliberately non-conventional language
- Demonstrates tension between statistical patterns and creative expression

## Key concepts

- **Alignment as social regulation**: Understanding alignment not just as technical problem but as enforcement of linguistic norms
- **Moscow Linguistic School**: Linguistic tradition that sought to reconcile structural and probabilistic views of meaning
- **Anomalous language**: Language that defies conventional expressive norms
- **Two-way interaction**: Alignment as mutual shaping between users and models

## Notes

This paper is particularly relevant for critical discussions of AI alignment, as it questions the assumptions underlying technical alignment research. The use of Joyce's *Ulysses* is methodologically interesting—the text is deliberately difficult and non-normative, making it a good test case for how LLMs handle linguistic deviation. The paper argues that alignment is not just about making AI "safe" but about enforcing particular linguistic and cultural norms.
