## Summary

This paper presents Agent Gym, a unified interactive framework for evaluating and training LLM-based agents across diverse environments. The framework covers 7 real-world scenarios, 14 environments, and 89 tasks, supporting unified, real-time, concurrent agent interaction. The authors provide an expanded instruction set, high-quality trajectories, and a benchmarking suite for developing LLM-based agents, and support interactive exploration and learning through multi-turn interactions and real-time feedback. They take initial steps to develop agents that handle diverse tasks via self-improvement and reinforcement learning; trained agents achieve results comparable to commercial models. Code, dataset, benchmark, and checkpoints are released at https://agentgym.github.io/.
