"Cloze Procedure": A New Tool
For Measuring Readability
BY

WILSON

L. TAYLOR*

Here is the first comprehensive statement of a research method
and its theory which were introduced briefly during a workshop
at the i953 AEI convention. included are findings from three
pilot studies and two experiments in which "doze procedure"
results are compared with those oj two readability formulas.

~

"CLOZE PROCEDURE" IS A NEW PSY-

chological tool for measuring the effectiveness of communication. The method is straightforward; the data are
easily quantifiable; the findings seem to
stand up.
At the outset, this tool was looked
on as a new approach to "readability."
It was so used in three pilot studies and
two experiments, the main findings of
which are reported here.
*The writer is particularly obligated to Prof.
Charles E. Osgood, University of I11inois, and
Melvin R. Marks, Personnel Research Section,
A.G.O., Department of the Army, for instigating
and assisting in the series of efforts that yielded
the notion of "cloze procedure." Both are experimental psychologists. Among others who have
advised, encouraged or otherwise aided are these
of the University of 11IInols: Prof. Lee J. Cronbach, educational psychologist and statistician;
Dean Wilbur Schramm, Division of Communications; Prof. Charles E. Swanson, Institute of
Communications Research, and George R. Klare,
psychologist, both of whom have authored articles on readability; and several journalism teachers who lent their classes. Kalmer E. Stordahl
and Clifford M. Christensen, until recently. research associates of the Institute, also contributed.

First, the results of the new method
were repeatedly shown to conform with
the results of the Flesch and Dale-Chall
devices for estimating, readability. Then
the scope broadened, and cloze procedure was pitted against those standard
formulas.
If future research substantiates the
results so far, this tool seems likely to
have a variety of applications, both
theoretical and practical, in other fields
involving communication functions.
THE "CLOZE UNIT"

At the heart of the procedure is a
functional unit of measurement tentatively dubbed a "cloze." It is pronounced like the verb "close" and is derived from "closure." The last term is
one gestalt psychology applies to the
human tendency to complete a familiar
but not-quite-finished pattern-to "see"
a broken circle as a whole one, for example, by mentally closing up the gaps.

416

JOURNALISM

One can complete the broken circle
because its shape or pattern is so familiar that, although much of it actually is
missing, it can be recognized anyway.
The same principle applies to language. Given "Chickens cackle and
- - - quack," almost anyone can instantly supply "ducks." If that word
really is the same as the one omitted,
the person scores one cloze unit for
correctly closing the gap in the language pattern.
Note that the sentence pattern is a
complex one made up of many subpatterns. One must know not only the
meanings (i.e., patterns of symbolmeaning relationships) and forms (patterns of letters) of all the five words,
but' also the meanings of given combinations of them-plus the fact that the
sentence structure seems to demand a
term parallel to "cackle" but associated
with ducks instead of chickens. In other
words, one must guess what the mutilated sentence means as a whole, then
complete its pattern to fit that whole
meaning.
A cloze unit may be defined as: Any
single occurrence of a successful attempt to reproduce accurately a part
deleted from a "message" (any language product) by deciding, from the
context that remains, what the missing
part should be.
Cloze procedure may be defined as:
A method of intercepting a message
from a "transmitter" (writer or speaker), mutilating its language patterns by
deleting parts, and so administering it
to "receivers" (readers or listeners)
that their attempts to make the patterns
whole again potentially yield a considerable number of cloze units.

QUARTERLY

is based, however, employed only reading materials and deleted only words.
In practice, the readabilities of two
or more passages of about equal length
were contrasted, for any given population, by:
1. Deleting an equal number of
words from each passage by some essentially random counting-out system.
Such a system was based on a table of
random numbers or else it simply
counted out every nth word (every fifth
one, for example) without any regard
for the functions or meanings of specific words.
2. Reproducing each mutilated passage with a blank of some standard
length (so the length would not influence the guessing) in place of every
missing word.
3. Giving copies of all reproduced
passages to all subjects-or to equal
numbers of randomly selected subjects
-in a sample group representative of
the population in question.
4. Asking all subjects to try to fill in
all blanks by guessing, from the context
of remaining words, what the missing
words should be.
5. Totaling for each passage separately the number of times original
words were correctly replaced, and considering these totals as readability
scores.
6. Contrasting the doze totals of the
various passages. The passage with the
highest score was considered "most
readable," the one with the secondhighest score next-most readable, etc.pending the outcome of statistical tests
of the significance of the differences observed.
SOME DISTINCTIONS

HOW THE METHOD WORKS

Cloze procedure is neither just another readability formula nor just another form of the familiar sentencecompletion test.

As defined, the concept of cloze procedure involves both oral and written
communication and does not specify
any particular kind of "part" for deletion. The research on which this report

Not a Formula
The cloze method is not a formula
at all.
Neither in theory nor practice does it
resemble current "element counting"

"Cloze Procedure"
devices (Flesch, Dale-Chall, etc.) which
assume a high correlation between ease
of comprehension and the frequency of
occurrence of selected kinds of language elements-short or common
words, short or simple sentences, certain parts of speech, the active voice,
"concrete" terms and such.
Cloze procedure counts no such elements. It seems, however, to measure
whatever effects elements actually may
have on readability. And it does so at
the same time that it is also taking account of the influences of many other
factors readability formulas ignore.
Typically, the formulas are insensitive to a particular population's previous knowledge of the topic being discussed. They cannot allow for the effects of non-idiomatic uses of common
words, nonsense combinations of
words, awkward and confusing sentence structure or pronouns without
definite antecedents. And the basic assumptions of formulas may be directly
contradicted.
"Respectability," despite its six syllables and high level of abstraction, is
much easier for the average reader than
"erg."
"He came in smiling and sat down"
is not approximately two or three times
as difficult as "He came in. He was
smiling. He sat down."
"I came like Water, and like Wind 1
go" from the Rubaiyat makes no sense
to second-graders even if they do know
all the words.
One can think of cloze procedure
as throwing all potential readability influences in a pot, letting them interact,
then sampling the result.
The procedure also might be likened
to a polling method with experimental
controls. It asks members of a population sample to demonstrate how well
they understand the meaning of a mutilated version of what some writer wrote
by having them "vote" on what the

417

missing words should be. The passage
whose deleted words are most often
"written in" on the "ballot" is elected
most readable.
More precisely, the cloze method
seems to deal with more-or-Iess parallel
sets of meaning-pattern relationships.
Different persons may express the same
meaning in somewhat differing ways,
and the same language patterns may
have differing meanings for different
people. Cloze procedure takes a measure of the likeness between the patterns a writer has used and the patterns
the reader is anticipating while he is
reading.

Not a Sentence-Completion Test
Obviously, cloze procedure is something like this familiar form of examination. It is similar in that the subject
is presented with incomplete sentences
and there are blanks to be filled in from
context.
But the typical sentence-completion
test is for gauging a person's knowledge of specific and more or less independent points of information, hence
the words to be deleted are pre-evaluated and selected accordingly. And for
every new topic, some well-versed person must construct and tryout a new
test based on another set of information.
For one thing, cloze procedure deals
with contextually interrelated series of
blanks, not isolated ones.
For another, the cloze method does
not deal directly with specific meaning.
Instead, it. repeatedly samples the extent of likeness between the language
patterns used by the writer to express
what he meant and those possibly different patterns which represent readers' guesses at what they think the
writer meant.
However, because it counts instances
of language-usage correspondence rath-

418

JOURNALISM

er than meanings themselves, the cloze
unit seems to classify as a common denominator of communication success;
and with it the readabilities of materials
on totally different topics can be compared directly.
For this sort of contrast, an essentially random deletion of words seems
required. And this makes the task of
actually picking out what words to delete purely clerical-and so simple that
anyone who can count to ten can do it
for any sort of material, regardless of
its topic or difficulty.
SOME THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS

The main contributions to the notion
of cloze procedure have come from the
concepts of "total language context,"
Osgood's "dispositional mechanisms"
and statistical random sampling.
1. Total Language Context

For more than half a century, experimenters have been reporting findings
that may be interpreted as showing that
language behavior depends on "total
context."
The results indicate that the ability to
identify, learn, recognize, remember or
produce any language "symbol" (element or pattern) depends heavily on the
variable degrees to which it is associated
with everything else by larger and
meaningful (familiar) overall combinations.t

The total context of any language behavior includes everything that tends to
motivate, guide, assist or hinder that
behavior. It includes verbal factorsgrammatical skills and multitudes of
symbols-and non-verbal ones such as
fears, desires, past experience and intelligence.
"I heard a - - bark" is likely to
elicit "dog" both because that word is
habitually associated with "bark" and

Communication (New York: McGraw-Hili, 1951).

QUARTERLY

because it fits in with past experience
with noisy dogs. If the verbal context is
enlarged to "For the first time, I heard
a --- bark," the impulse to supply
"dog" may be reduced by commonsense; the subject may ask himself:
"Who is this guy that has never heard a
dog? Could he be referring to some
other animal?" And if the preceding
sentence has mentioned a voyage to the
Pribilof Islands, the reader may draw
on past knowledge to produce "seal."
Quite recently, Marks and Taylor reported an experiment in which the influences of varying intensities of both
verbal and non-verbal contextual factors on the generation of language elements were shown to be measurable by
quantitative methods."
2. Dispositional Mechanisms
The notion of cloze procedure was
"sparked" by implications of Osgood's
learning theory of communication. He
relates the "redundancies" and "transitional probabilities" of language to the
development of "dispositional mechanisms" that play a large part in both
transmitting and receiving messages,"
Redundancy-"Man coming" means
the same as "A man is coming this way
now." The latter, which is more like
ordinary English, is redundant; it indicates the singular number of the subject
three times (by "a," "man," and "is"),
the present tense twice ("is coming"
and "now"), and the direction of action
twice ("coming" and "this way"). Such
repetitions of meaning, such internal
ties between words, make it possible to
replace "is," "this," "way," or "now,"
should anyone of them be missed.

"Gloze Procedure"
Transitional
Probabilities - Some
words are more likely than others to
appear in certain patterns or sequences.
"Merry Christmas" is a more probable
combination than "Merry birthday."
"Please pass the - - - " is more often
completed by "salt" than by "sodium
chloride" or "blowtorch." Some transitions from one word to the next are,
therefore, more probable than others.
Dispositional

Language

Habits-In

learning "to think in" a language, an
individual develops an enormous number of complex verbal skill patterns"bundles of skill sequences"-which
stand for innumerable kinds and shades
of meaning and tend to become so automatic that they "run themselves off"
in pertinent situations. These habits reflect the redundancies and transitional
probabilities of the language patterns
these skills involve.
Out of his personal experiences and
circumstances, each human develops his
own set of these habits. To the extent
that his set corresponds to the sets of
others in his culture, he can communicate easily; he and they have learned
similar meaning-language relationships
-the same patterns of symbols go with
the same meanings. But any two sets of
language mechanisms can differ considerably within the same culture; one man
becomes more disposed to run off particular sequences than another man
does. To the same extent, the related
sets of redundancies and transitional
probabilities can differ also.
Habits of expression take over most
of the work of translating an individual's meaning into an organized series
of language symbols for transmission to
others. Likewise, his habits of reading
or listening cause him to anticipate
words, almost automatically, when he
is receiving messages. When he sees the
start of a phrase that looks familiar, he
immediately tends to complete it in his
own way even when the written phrase
actually ends differently.
When words come in sequences that
best fit the existing receiving habits of a
reader, he understands with little effort.

419

When the symbols appear in less familiar sequences, comprehension is slower
and less sure. And sufficiently improbable patterns seem like nonsense; they
do not stand for anything in his experience.

3. Random Deletion
A random deletion method (or an
every-nth equivalent) which ignores the
differences between specific words appears to be not only defensible but rationally inescapable when doze procedure is used for contrasting readabilities.
The main reasons for this view relate
to two questions most often asked by
those who have seen the data of this
report.
Question 1: How can a random system play fair when some words are
easier to replace than others?
Obviously, one is more likely to be
able to supply "an" in "A quinidine is
- - alkaloid isomeric . . ." than to
guess "$6,425" in "The city council
voted
for a new swimming
pool." Yet the former example is far
more difficult reading.
The answer is that if enough words
are struck out at random, the blanks
will come to represent proportionately
all kinds of words to the extent that
they occur. The matter boils down to
"How many blanks are enough?"-a
problem to be settled by experiment.
Somewhat the same principle is involved in the substitution of a more
convenient every-nth system for a random one. For several blanks, an everynth system might tend to fall in with
the "rhythm" of an author's style and
take out mostly nouns, or mostly articles. . . . The answer is that rhythms
break, and nth deletions, if continued
long enough, start taking out other parts
of speech and, eventually, yield the
equivalent of random deletion. Again,
the practical question is "How many
are enough?"

420

JOURNALISM

Question 2: Wouldn't a deletion system be more sensitive and more reliable
if it dealt only with words classified,
say, by their "importance to meaning"
or their familiarity as gauged by tabled
frequencies of use?
The answer seems to be "No."
For one thing, specified words or
kinds of words may not occur equally
often in different materials. That fact
itself may be a readability factor, and
its effect can be measured only by a
method that operates independently.

An attempt to restrict a counting-out
system to "important" words (nouns
and verbs, for example, as against articles and conjunctions) may find that
one of two equally long passages contains twice as many "importants" as the
other! What then?
Because the effect of such a difference
needs to be included in-not excluded
from-the results, it seems necessary to
let the occurrences of' presumably important _words be represented proportionately in deletions.
What has just been stated about deleting only "important" words applies
with equal force to varying degrees of
familiarity.
Also, it should be remembered that
doze procedure deals only with words
as they actually occur in larger patterns which stand for particular meanings at the time they are transmitted or
received. The result is that infrequently
used words may not be hard to replace
at all; and supposedly unimportant
words may become extremely so.
Most Americans can effortlessly supply "tipped" and "lady" in "The polite
old gentleman always
his hat
when he met a ---." The ability to
do so has very little to do with the frequency with which those words, considered individually, occur in the language;
"the," which is hundreds of times more
common, simply doesn't fit in either
blank. The kind of frequency that most
matters here is frequency-in-context.
An article can be more important to

QUARTERLY

meaning than any other word in its sentence, and harder to replace than the
words in the previous example. "You
want to know what the wolf did to the
sheep? He killed - - sheep." Note that
"sheep," a noun and the object of the
verb, matters hardly at all in its second
appearance. Also, if the missing word is
"a," it would be quite difficult to guess
correctly-because "the," "some," "every," "many," "no" or some finite number could fit too.
"SCORES"-NOT FREQUENCIES

For the purpose of statistical analysis, cloze data are treated as "true
scores" throughout this report.
This is in conformance with the
opinion of Lee J. Cronbach. He said
the nature of cloze results satisfies the
assumptions for scores, but not those
for chi-square frequency tests because
successive cloze units cannot be considered independent.
If, in "Then he took off his hat,"
"he" and "his" both were blanked out"
getting the first right would probably
mean getting "his" right too; just as
"she" would go with "her."
At first sight, cloze results appeared
to be frequencies (the mere number of
times missing words were correctly replaced). But "correctly" implies an
underlying qualitative continuum of
relative rightness ranging from a completely inappropriate word, through
poor, medium and good synonyms, to
the exact word left out. Whether or not
only precise matches are counted does
not affect the existence of such a continuum.
GEN;BRAL PROCEDURE; PLAN OF REPORT

For clarity's sake, it seems best to
present the report of Experiment 1
completely-specific purposes, procedure and results-before starting on
Experiment 2. However, some procedural aspects were common to all research designs used.

"Cloze Procedure"
For deletion purposes, a "word" was
defined by the white spaces with which
an author had separated it from other
words.
Contractions like "don't"; abbreviations like "Mr." or "U.N."; figures like
"1,006"; hyphenated combinations like
"self-conscious"-all these were considered as single words. But "self conscious," written without the hyphen,
counted as two.
All passages were 175-plus words in
length; the sentence in which the 175th
word occurred was reproduced in full.
Only "mechanical" deletion systems,
random or every-nth, were employed.
After mutilation, each version of a
passage was reproduced on separate
typewriter-size sheets with an underlined blank 10 spaces long in place of
each missing word.
The sheets for anyone subject were
assembled in a predetermined order and
stapled together with an explanatory
foreword. Such assemblies were randomly assigned to subjects.
Pilot studies used small groups of
subjects, a dozen or less, chosen on a
casual "handy and willing" basis. The
subjects were not supervised and no
time limits were set.
The experiments, however, used
larger groups made up exclusively of
juniors and seniors in University of
Illinois journalism courses. The administrator read the foreword aloud and
answered questions regarding it before
subjects began work. Each subject was
allowed from 10 to 15 minutes for fill• Source-Author & Work

ing in the blanks of each mutilated
passage he received.
EXPERIMENT 1
PURPOSES AND PROCEDURE

Three passages borrowed directly
from Flesch's How to Test Readability 4
were used in Experiment 1 and the two
pilot studies which preceded it. Listed in
a footnote 5 are the original sources of
the passages, the pages on which they
are found in the Flesch book, the "reading ease" scores given by that author,
and the Dale-Chall scores computed by
this experimenter,"
The main purpose here was to see if
cloze scores also would rank these passages as the formulas do. If the ranks
were maintained, the differences among
the cloze scores would be tested for
statistical significance.
The research designs of this experiment and its pilot studies also sought
answers to several methodological questions. It was asked whether significant
differences in relative cloze scores
would accompany variations in:
(1) Word-deletion systemsa. Random deletion vs. the more
convenient system of counting out every
nth word.
b. Counting out every fifth word, for
example, vs. every tenth.
c. Counting out "few" (16) words
per passage vs. "many" (35) words.
(2) Presentation ordersPresenting .mutilated passages in one
order vs. presenting them in another.
(3) Scoring methodsScoring as correct only those fill-ins

that precisely matched original words
vs. the more tedious process of judging
synonyms and allowing half for each
"good enough" one.

Because cloze data for the three passages would be correlated, such computation also _would yield an F for the
overall difference among subjects.

To explore the word-deletion questions, each passage was mutilated by
three different systems: "Every fifth,"
"every tenth" and "random 10 percent."
In Pilot Study 1, the initial word,
then every fifth word thereafter, was
knocked out until 35 words, about 20
percent of the total number of original
ones, were missing.
Both Pilot Study 2 and Experiment 1
contrasted random and every-nth systems of deleting about I0 percent of
total wordage.
One system was based on a table of
random numbers; the other counted out
every tenth word. Each system deleted
16 original words from each passage.
(Almost entirely different sets of
words were taken out by the different
deletion methods. There was no overlap
at all between the every-nth systems.
The random 10 percent system took out
only two of the same words deleted by
each of the every-nth ones.)

3. The relationship between the
cloze scores for the three passages
would remain essentially the same despite the use of different word-deletion
systems or the specific words they
counted out, despite different presentation orders, and despite different scoring methods.
Pilot Studies 1 and 2 used 6 and 12
subjects, respectively. Experiment 1
used 24 subjects. In every case, a subject received all three passages.

To discover possible order effects, all
six orders of three passages (abc, acb,
bac, bca, cab, and cba) were equally
represented in each pilot study and in
the experiment.
The scoring-method question was disposed of after data of Pilot Study 2
were evaluated in both ways and the
results were compared.
In summary, these hypotheses were
developed and tested by Experiment 1
and its pilot studies:
1. Cloze scores would rank the
three passages in the same order as the
two standard formulas.
2. For any condition of data gathering, the overall difference among the
scores of the three passages would yield
a significant value of F, as computed by
analysis of variance, double classification.

RESULTS

This summary concerns itself mainly
with the findings of Experiment 1,
which tested hypotheses inferred from
the empirical findings of the preceding
pilot studies. However, certain pilotstudy results also are presented.
Some findings of both studies appear
in Table 1 with reference to the "existence" and discriminatory powers of
cloze scores as related to various methods of gathering them. Further, Pilot
Study 2 was itself the experimental test
of the hypothesis, drawn from the first
study, that the evaluation and scoring
of synonyms would not be profitable
(See Table 2).

1. "Existence" of Gloze Measure
of Readability
Entries in Table 1 show how consistently cloze scores ranked the three
selected passages in the same order of
readability as do the Flesch and DaleChall formulas. One could assume that
cloze procedure and the formulas were
measuring the same thing.
2. Power of Discrimination
For every experimental condition entered in Table 1, analysis of variance
of the overall difference among the

423

"Cloze Procedure"
cloze scores of the three passages yielded an F which was very highly significant, to above the 0.1 percent level of
confidence.
All figures in the first five columns of
Table 1 (this excludes validation entries
from Experiment 2) involve correlated
data; that is, all subjects were given all
three passages, hence the type of analysis of variance called for ("double clas-

sification") discriminated among subjects as well as passages.
All but one of the between-subject F's
were significant to the 5 percent level or
higher.

about methodology appear in both Table 1 and Table 2.

a. Deletion Systems-Table 1 shows
that variations in totals of blanks per
passage, amounts of deletion ranging
from 10 percent to 20 percent, random
and every-nth systems, and almost entirely different sets of specific words
knocked out-all were accompanied by
results that consistently upheld both the
"existence" of cloze procedure as a
readability measure and its power to
discriminate between passages.
Qualitatively, then, all conditions
yielded the same results. There appeared, however, some quantitative dif-

QUARTERLY

ferences-that is, some conditions were
more "efficient" than others, particularly with regard to the discovery that the
analysis also discriminated among subjects.
The 35 blanks and every-fifth deletion
of Pilot Study 1 discriminated better between its six subjects than did Pilot
Study 2, based on only 16 blanks, between its 12 subjects. (Perhaps the former group was simply more heterogeneous, but it also may be that the degree
of significance found depends on plenty
of blanks or on greater intensities of
deletion.)

In the breakdown of Experiment 1
results between random and every-nth
systems, the random 10 percent yielded
a highly significant between-subject F,
put the every-tenth data, while qualitatively similar, failed to reach the 5 percent level. (It seems that the contrast
should be interpreted as meaning that
random and every-nth systems will give
more nearly equivalent results if more
than 16 blanks are deleted per passage.)

In the experimenter's opinion, the
first of these is by far the easiest to read
of all the passages used, and the other
two are next-hardest and hardest, respectively. It was expected that what
were subjectively assumed to be the
"true" readabilities of all three selections would be under-rated or overrated by either or both formulas.

b. Synonyms-Table 2 entries indicate that the more tedious method of
judging synonyms as "good enough" to
be allocated half-counts yielded slightly
larger total scores for the passages, but
the degree of differentiation was virtually identical to scoring only precise
matches.
Note the similarity in the proportions of the two kinds of totals broken
down between passages.

The Stein selection, although it
seemed comparatively unintelligible, was
characterized by words both short and
familiar and by short sentences. . . . It
was thought that both formulas would
over-rate its readability inasmuch as the
Flesch device counts only the number
of syllables per word and the number of
words per sentence, and the Dale-Chall
method counts only the number of
words per sentence and the number of
words not on a list of familiar words.
The other two passages were expected to "fool" the Flesch formula more
than the Dale-Chall one.
It was thought that the Caldwell selection would be under-rated by the
Flesch method because it contains rather
long sentences consisting largely of independent clauses connected by "and,"
and because this fact would not be offset by consideration of the familiarity
of the vocabulary.
Flesch's formula was expected to
over-rate the Joyce selection's readability. That passage is made up of relatively short words and sentences, but
many of the words appear in no dictionary.

c. Presentation Orders-Table 2
also shows that the orders in which the
three passages were presented had virtually no effect on their scores. (It was
assumed, therefore, that order effects
are unimportant.)
EXPERIMENT 2
PURPOSES AND PROCEDURE

The list of passages for this experiment was expanded to eight by adding
five more to the three already used.
Two considerations governed the
choice of additional passages. Desired
were (1) a list of passages that seemed
to be distributed fairly evenly over a
long hard-to-easy range and (2) the inclusion of materials which, it was
thought, would show that cloze procedure could "handle" passages which
neither of the standard formulas could.
Both considerations were served by
the choice ofpassages from:
Erskine Caldwell, Georgia Boy 7
Gertrude Stein, Geography and Plays 8
James Joyce, Einnegans Wake 9

The two selections still needed to
bring the total to eight were chosen
after trying out four other passages in
Flesch's book on readability testing.
Those four, together with the places
where they are reprinted, were from
• From short story, "My Old Man and Pretty
Sooky," passage beginning "My old man picked
up one morning •.." p. 80 (New York: Avon,
1946).
8 Passage beginning "So the main is seen and
the green is green," pp. 84-85 (Boston: Four
Seas, 1922).
• Passage beginning "But who comes yond with
pire on poletop?" p. 244 (New York: Viking,
1943).

JOURNALISM

Swift's Gulliver's Travels, p. 14;
Charles Dickens' Bleak House, P: 15;
William James' Psychology, P: 19; and
Article I, Section 10, U. S. Constitution, p. 28.
Altogether, 10 passages, these four
and the six already earmarked for Experiment 2, were used in Pilot Study 3.
Each of the six subjects received copies
of all and was allowed to take them
home and complete them at leisure.
All passages used in this pilot study
and the final experiment were mutilated
by still another deletion system; every
seventh word was counted out until
each passage had 25 blanks.
Analysis of the pilot study's results
showed that the Swift and Dickens selections tended to distribute themselves
conveniently with respect to the six
passages already chosen, hence the ones
from William James and the Constitution were discarded.
The eight passages thus chosen for
Experiment 2 then were ranked by their
median cloze scores, and the order in
which they fell was considered a prediction of how larger groups would rank
them.
Additional Flesch and Dale-Chall
scores were computed, and the ranks in
which they fell also were considered as
predictions.
These were the chief hypotheses
tested by Experiment 2:
1. The main results of Experiment 1
would be validated.
2. The readability order of eight
passages, as empirically determined by
Pilot Study 3, would dependably predict the rank order of the cloze scores
given them by other and larger samples
of subjects.
3. Cloze procedure would handle
materials which either or both of the
standard formulas could not.
4. Cloze predictions would be more

QUARTERLY

successful than those of the two formulas in guessing the ranks of final cloze
scores.
5. The overall difference among the
cloze scores of the various passages
would be found significant when submitted to analysis of variance.
Because only half an hour was available for the administration of Experiment 2, each subject received only two
of the eight passages. Each of the selections Pilot Study 3 indicated as among
the four easier ones was paired with
each of those which seemed to be
among the four harder, the easier always preceding the harder in assembly.
The 16 kinds of pairs were represented four times each in the final data, to
which a total of 72 subjects contributed. Each passage was administered to
18 subjects.
The final experiment's data also were
subjected to certain exploratory attacks:
1. To see how finely the cloze method seemed to discriminate between
readability levels, passages adjacent in
final rank were taken two at a time,
and the significance of the difference
between their mean scores was computed by the t-test for small samples.
2. What may be called the "internal
consistency" of cloze results was attacked from the standpoints both of
passages and of subjects by "fractionation" methods.
The total cloze score for each passage was broken down into subtotals
showing the aggregate score for that
passage for the first five blanks, the second five blanks, etc., until all fifths of
25 blanks were represented. The passages then were ranked by these subtotals for each five-blank series. Then
the degree of overall rank correlation
for all passages for all five of these
fifths of total blanks was computed.
Then the question was asked: Did
subjects who were higher in total cloze

"Gloze Procedure"
scores also tend to make consistently
higher scores for fractions of the 25blank series? The subjects for each passage were divided into thirds. and the
performances of those in the upper
third-as judged by total scores-were
compared with the performances of
those in the lower third.
RESULTS

Data pertinent to all findings under
this heading, except for the "validation"
one disposed of in the next paragraph,
are shown in Tables 3 and 4.
1. Validation of Experiment l's

Findings
Entered in Table I are certain of
Experiment 2's results that verify the
"existence" and power-of-discrimination
findings for the three passages used in
Experiment I and its pilot studies.
Note that Experiment 2 used still another deletion system on the passages
by Boswell, Huxley and Henry James.
Its every-seventh method took out a set
of 25 words that overlapped the 10 percent systems, random and every-tenth,
only two words each; and it struck out
only five of the 35 words which the
every-fifth system deleted.

427

jects. Experimental conditions allowed
only two passages to be administered to
anyone subject, and the experiment's
design was such as to reduce correlation
between the results of any two passages
to the minimum of 28 percent; that is,
only five of the 18 subjects who rated
any passage also were among the 18
who rated any other passage. Experiment 2's scores for different passages
were, therefore, assumed to be independent.

3. Handling of Certain Materials
It seems indisputable that cloze procedure came closer than either of the
standard formulas to ranking properly
the relative readability levels of certain
passages.

The Stein passage, for example, is
ranked first by both formulas. The
Flesch method concludes it is "very
easy" reading, and the Dale-Chall score
rates it as within the comprehension
level of fourth or fifth grade school
children!
Otherwise, the two formulas did not
perform very similarly. The Dale-Chall
ranks for the Caldwell and Joyce selections appear to make much more sense
than the Flesch ratings of them.

2. Predictive Success of Pilot Study 3

4. Gloze Predictions Better for
Population Used

Table 3 shows that Pilot Study 3's
median scores for six subjects ranked
the eight passages in almost exactly the
same way as did the performances of
the IS-subject groups used in Experiment 2.

It follows from the findings just set
down that previous cloze results were
more successful than those of the two
standard formulas in predicting the
ranks of future cloze results for the
population used.

The rank difference coefficient of .98
exceeds the 0.1 percent level of confidence. The Boswell and Huxley passages in the middle of the distribution
changed places, but Table 4 shows that
those two passages did not receive significantly different cloze totals anyway.
Note that although the same six subjects participated in the predictions for
all eight passages (hence Pilot Study 3's
data were correlated), in the experiment that followed, each passage was
rated by the performance of a relatively
separate and independent group of sub-

Although the rank correlation, .70,
between the Flesch and Dale-Chall predictions is moderately significant (to
above the 5 percent level of confidence),
neither of those sets of predictions correlate significantly either with cloze predictions or with final cloze results.
The lower part of Table 3 demonstrates how the removal from consideration of the data from any one-or any
two-of the three handpicked passages
(Stein, Joyce and Caldwell) would
change the measures of the predictive
accuracies of the formulas.

428

JOURNALISM

5. Significance of Difference Among
Passages
Table 4 shows that analysis of variance, simple classification, yielded an F
for the overall difference among the
scores of various passages which is significant far above the 0.1 percent level.

QUARTERLY

Because each passage was administered to a relatively distinct group of 18
subjects, Bartlett's homogeneity of variance test was used. Its non-significant
finding justifies the assumption that the
differences between passage scores need
not be attributed to mere differences between the groups.

The ranks of Pilot Study 3 scores from six subjects are shown to have predicted almost
perfectly how larger groups of subjects would rank eight passages. The doze predictions
suffered only one reversal; it occurred in mid-scale and involved two passages whose
scores were not significantly different anyway (see Table 4). The two standard formulas
stumbled in their predictions. Both rated the Stein passage as most readable. The Flesch
formula had a bad time with the Caldwell and Joyce passages; it rated them equally as
"fairly easy."

Each passage was administered to a relatively separate group of 18 subjects, hence
analysis assumed the means to be non-correlated. Actually, because each subject rated
two passages, there was a fractional correlation between the subjects involved with any
pair of passages; five subjects would be in both groups of 18. It was assumed legitimate
to ignore this 28 percent overlap. . . . All P's shown are "two-tailed"; under justifying
experimental conditions, such P's as these could be halved and significance levels raised.
EXPLORATORY FINDINGS

1. Differences between Adjacent
Passages
Table 4 shows the results of t-test
analysis of the differences between the
mean scores of passages adjacent in
final rank.
The sizes of the P's indicate that the

Caldwell passage scored significantly
higher than the Dickens one, the Dickens one significantly higher than the
middle five (Boswell, Swift, Huxley,
Henry James and Stein), and that
whole group higher than the Joyce selection. Also, the last was significantly
above hypothetical zero.

Within the group of five, no passage
scored significantly higher than the one
adjacent in rank, but those in alternate
ranks were associated with moderately
significantly different scores. (See footnotes of Table 4.)
The P's in the table are all "twotailed." That means that when experimental conditions justify the processwhich passage is the more readable is
already known, therefore the only question is how much-such P's could be
halved and the level of significance more
easily reached.

2. Internal Consistency
The overall rank correlation between
the performances of all eight passages,
as expressed by their score subtotals on
five-blank fifths of 25 blanks, was
computed by a method described by
Kendall.t? It yielded a "W," or "coefficient of concordance," of .56, which is
significant to above the I percent level
of confidence.
This suggests that the passages would
have been ranked in about the same
way even if only, say, half as many
words had been deleted in each passage.
This "w" of .56 is the equivalent of
an "average rho" of .455, which could
otherwise be computed by finding the
ten possible rank difference coefficients
between five sets of rankings, taken two
at a time, and calculating the mean.
Further investigation into passage
consistency considered larger fractions
of 25-blank totals. When data associated
,. Maurice G. Kendall, The Advanced Theory
of Statistics, Vol. 1 (London: Griffin & Co.,
1948).

with the 13th blank were discarded and
results for the remaining 24 blanks were
divided into thirds, the three ranks of
subtotals yielded a higher W, of .68.
And when all data were divided into
dovetailed halves corresponding to oddand even-numbered blanks (with the
data of the 25th blank split between
them) the two sets of rankings yielded
a rank correlation coefficient of .95.
To investigate subject consistency,
the total scores of those six subjects
who scored highest on every passage
were broken down to correspond to
five-blank fifths of 25 blanks. Then the
subtotals for the different passages were
combined. The same was done for the
six who scored lowest on every passage.
The contrasting pairs of subtotals are
shown in Table 5.
Pushing this line of inquiry farther,
the aggregate dozes of the. "highs" and
"lows" for each passage were examined
blank by blank as they accumulated. In
the case of every passage, the cumulative score of the high scorers quickly
separated from that of the low groupusually within the first five blanksafter which the groups continued to
diverge.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
It was assumed that the relative readabilities of two or more written passages of about equal length could be
contrasted by mechanically deleting an
equal number of words in each, then
totaling, for each passage, the number
of times subjects succeeded in reproducing missing words.

"Cloze Procedure"
1. Ranked Relative Readability

Under a variety of data-gathering
conditions, cloze scores consistently
ranked three selected passages in the
same way that the Flesch and DaleChall readability formulas do. If the
formulas accurately ranked them, cloze
procedure did too.

2. Statistically Useful Contrasts
Also found was evidence that the
cloze method could discriminate effectively between different levels of readability-that is, was sufficiently sensitive
to yield statistically contrastable scores.
The overall difference among the
scores of the three passages most used
was found to be highly significant under
all data-gathering conditions.
Likewise, the overall difference among
the scores of eight passages used in the
final experiment was highly significant.
Further, exploratory analysis of the
final experiment's data showed that
some of the individual differences between the scores of passages adjacent in
rank, taken two at a time, were highly
significant. And all differences between
those alternate in rank were at least
moderately significant.

3. Reliability and Prediction
The mere repetitive ranking of three
passages in the same way was rough
evidence of the reliability of cloze results. More dramatic was the finding
that the median scores of six subjects
on eight passages ranked those passages
in almost precisely the same way as did
subsequent scores of relatively independent groups of 18 subjects, one
group to a passage.
Further evidence of the cloze method's reliability as a way to compare
passages was the exploratory "internal
consistency" finding that a significant
overall rank correlation existed between
the ways in which passages ranked on
each five-blank fifth of Experiment 2's
2S-blank series.

431

4. Range of Applicability
Cloze procedure, in both a pilot study
and the final experiment, assessed the
assumed "true" readabilities of passages
by Caldwell, Gertrude Stein and James
Joyce more adequately than either or
both of the standard formulas. Both
formulas, for example, seemed to err
badly in ranking the Stein passage as
most readable of the eight employed.
However, the point here is not that
the formulas did poorly, for that was
preordained. Those three passages were
handpicked because their characteristics
violated certain common assumptions.
about what sorts of language elements
correlate highly with readability. The
real point is that cloze procedure appeared to handle those passages adequately.

5. Methodology
Analyses of cloze scores gathered by
contrasting methods yielded qualitatively similar and quantitatively significant differences for passages despite:
a. Different mutilation systems-random vs, every nth; deletion densities
varying from 10 percent to 20 percent
of original words; totals of blanks varying from 16 to 3S per passage; and almost entirely different sets of specific
words blanked out.
b. The orders in which two or more
passages were administered to the same
subject.
c. Ignoring vs. allowing for synonyms in final scoring.
However, some methods seemed to
be relatively more efficient quantitatively. More needs to be determined about
the comparative advantages of random
vs, every-nth systems; various intensities
of deletion; minimum sizes of population samples, etc.

6. Between Subjects
The possibility of using cloze procedure for contrasting the reading abilities
of different individuals-as opposed to

432

J9URNALISM

the readabilities of different passageswas clearly suggested by the betweenSUbject F's associated with finding between-passage F's in the correlated data
of Pilot Studies 1 and 2 and Experiment 1.
This suggestion also is supported by
the results of the "internal consistency"
exploration of the fractionated performances of high- and low-scoring individuals in Experiment 2.
DISCUSSION
Evaluation
At present, the more outstanding
characteristics of cloze procedure appear to be: The fact that it worked, its
"mechanical" simplicity, the range of
influences it involves, and its apparent
possibilities for future use.
All hypotheses developed and tested
seemed to stand up. Of course, the conclusions do not yet bear much generalizing-they apply only to the specific
passages employed-but they were consistent.

To avoid misunderstanding, it is emphasized that the observed contrasts in
the readability of passages are not to be
extended either to the works from which
the selections were drawn, or to the
styles of the authors themselves. To
make conclusions about the works or
the authors would require the use of
adequately representative samples of
materials.

QUARTERLY

that so plagues "content analysis" could

.be avoided.

Because various kinds of deletion systems yielded corresponding results, most
of the questions concerning them seem
to boil down to using enough blanks
and determining, by further experiment,
whether an every-fifth system is more or
less efficient than, for example, an everytenth or every-15th one. Or how many
every-nth blanks are necessary to yield
a dependable equivalent to a random
system that takes out enough words.

Potentially important, it seems, is the
fact that a cloze score appears to be a
measure of the aggregate influences of
all factors which interact to affect the
degree of correspondence between the
language patterns of transmitter and receiver. As such, its potential usefulness
is by no means confined either to readability or to the reading abilities of
individuals.
It seems that the effect of any manipulable factor, or any combination of
two or three of them, might be measured by properly controlled experiments
which contrast the cloze performances
of groups equated or homogeneous with
respect to other factors.

As it now stands, cloze procedure not
only needs research to make it as efficient as possible but it needs to be better validated and the range of its possible applications explored.'

Their use does not require word deletion, the reproduction of materials, experimental controls, and representative
population samples. (They do, of
course, have similar material-sampling
problems.)
Also, for what may be called "standard" materials, these formulas seem
reasonably accurate-the occurrences
of the elements they choose to count
usually do correlate better than chance
with such criteria of validity as comprehension test scores and lists of graded
readings.
And they are "reliable." With relatively little training, different users of
the same formula get virtually identical
results for the same materials. Also, the
results of different formulas have often

been shown to correlate significantly.
Their disadvantages, however, are
too important to be overlooked.
There seems no positive way to identify in advance which materials are
"standard" enough to be handled by a
particular formula.
"Reliability" isn't everything; a formula can be reliably wrong. Anyone
using either the Flesch or Dale-Chall
formula on the eight passages in Experiment 2 would have to conclude that
the Stein selection is the "easiest."
Also, it seems that a readability
gauge might well be flexible enough to
apply not only to a generalized "average American," for example, but to particular populations too. It is a little unreasonable that a single readability
score for an article on cattle breeding
should apply alike to residents of Texas
"cow country" and metropolitan Brooklyn. In such cases, it appears that the
user of a formula might employ doze
procedures to check up on his results.

"The editorial page [should be] the instrument through which a newspaper seeks to influence public opinion in what its publisher and editors,
its reporters and deskmen consider to be the right direction.
"To do this effectively, a newspaper must work at the task steadily and
consistently, not be forever jumping from one crusadeto another. After
all, a newspaper, like an individual, only has so many basic ideals and
principles. But by applying them to various situations as they arise, a newspaper can indoctrinate its readers with its own beliefs and obtain their
.acceptance in the community.
"We do not like it if the people of Toledo ask what stand the Blade is.
going to take on a sharp, given issue. If we have done our work well and
made our principles known, they should know how we will apply them to
any particular problem.
"And so when a storm of controversy breaks out over the admission of
Negroes to public housing projects where segregation had been practiced,
it is not so much what we say then that will calm the furor and lead to the
right solution. It is what we have been saying on our editorial page for
years which counts when such a crisis comes."-MICHAEL BRADSHAW,
editor, the Toledo Blade, in address at 1953 AEJ convention.
