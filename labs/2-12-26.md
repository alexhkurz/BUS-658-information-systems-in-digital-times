## 2-12-26 Lab

Today's lab is designed to for us to get an idea of your current ability to "hack" a project (e.g. some data analytics) quickly. 

We will assign groups, and over 1.5 hours, we want you to make 1 interesting figure, table or finding, to share with everyone after we regroup. 

The figure, table, or finding should in some way relate to the our reading themes of "how will AI impact the economy or society?" or "how does AI work and how should it be managed?" Ideally, it will relate to either your 'interesting question' or one of the specific questions discussed in class.

As we work, you are encouraged to use any tool you are familiar with:
-  Excel
-  Python
-  Stata
-  Cursor
-  Any online chatbot

Your final submission should take the form of 1-2 slides. Professor Kurz will demonstrate how to incorporate images into markdown.
